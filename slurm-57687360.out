This might not be in the topic of Cambridge but we are both Cambridge students so deal with it. I‚Äôm a straight trans dude and last year I made a very close friend who is a lesbian. I transitioned a year ago. I‚Äôve always had a bit of a crush on my friend but she is gay so I didn‚Äôt have much hope and was happy with the friendship. We‚Äôve been texting all summer and she confessed she has a crush on me. At first I was ecstatic that she shared my feelings but then I asked - but aren‚Äôt you gay? And she said that she is but I‚Äôm the exception because I‚Äôm so great and ‚Äústill have lady parts‚Äù. I feel so conflicted - I am so happy she is into me but I feel like she doesn‚Äôt think of me as a man and sees me as a lesbian‚Ä¶ any advice? Should I tell her how hurt I feel by not being seen for who I am by the person I thought is the closest to me? Should I break all of the friendship off? Please please help me

In response to the varsity article which seemed to be pro working the summer camps I would like to bring up the darker side which was hinted at but not really explored (which isn't to say that the good experiences weren't valid). When I worked camp, we were working 12-16 hours a day, with one day off every two weeks. The pay, when you take account of that many hours, was less than minimum wage. We also had to pay for our own dbs checks which were docked from wages, despite the fact that our contracts said they would cover expenses like that.
The kids themselves were *mostly* fine. They are from very wealthy backgrounds, and act like it, but most are alright. But when you do get a bad one, its awful. The camp is getting too much money to kick them out so nothing is done lest the parents complain- I won't go into the incident I'm referring to because it was awful but suffice to say the police should have been involved and weren't called. 
Then there's the fact that in many of these jobs you're the 'welfare' person. Its important to note that most courses you have a site manager and a deputy, and then your student workers. That's it. You're left to deal with these kids mental health without any support, and the extra stress on them from being away from home means that sometimes very serious incidents occur. I ended up with one of these, and was offered support only by my fellow student workers not management. 

Its great if you had a good experience, but personally I could never in good faith recommend working one of these courses. They're cash grabs for management, and student workers are left to deal with very serious child protection issues which should be left to professionals.

Following #Camfession41160, things I wish I'd heard as an undergrad:

1. It‚Äôs okay to not force a friend group, and to focus on quality over quantity in friends. 
2. You don‚Äôt have to feel guilty about going out for days in a row, or feel like you‚Äôre not having enough fun because you‚Äôve worked for the last 3 days. It‚Äôs all about balance. 
3. Social media is a lie. In Cambridge it‚Äôs an even bigger lie.
4. Everyone is still growing, learning, changing etc. You‚Äôll drift in and out of connections and friendships, partly because you are becoming different people. 
5. Relationships, dating and meeting people are often seen as a big part of uni life. They can enrich your experience, but if it doesn‚Äôt happen, it doesn‚Äôt happen, and that‚Äôs okay. Equally, if you do end up in a relationship, this can be amazing, but also please look after yourself, maintain those friendships (please do not drop your friends), and keep doing you- you were a person before the relationship, and you will be one after. 
6. Breakups are hard wherever you are, but in a tiny place like Cambridge, where everyone knows everyone, and it‚Äôs hard to get space, they can be even harder :( Take as much time as you you need, and don‚Äôt feel like you need to rush the healing just because of how fast-paced term life is.
7. Take BREAKS. Like actually. Especially over the summer and in holidays. Reconnect with home friends, family, family friends‚Ä¶ whatever makes you happy! Live for a bit outside the bubble.
8. Work as you go along. Cannot emphasise this enough. From a humanities student, actually read and research for your essay every week, write notes, gather material. It will mean revising is simply shortlisting and cutting down notes you‚Äôve already made. So much easier and the absolute key to success and not feeling super overwhelmed just before exams.
9.  Try things! Try going out, try extracurriculars even if you don‚Äôt think you‚Äôll be good at them, say yes to things- take risks. Lots won‚Äôt pay off, but some will, massively. You never know what you might end up loving, and you never know what amazing people you might meet. 
10. There unfortunately are, like everywhere, some toxic, not-so-nice people here. You won‚Äôt get on with everyone. Friendships you thought you‚Äôd leave with will end. People can be cruel. Behaviour will get tolerated. But there are also incredibly kind, fun, hilarious and interesting people out there too. 
11. Please do not compare. It is the absolute worst thing you can do. Don‚Äôt compare your grades, your social life, your dating life, what job offer someone has. Everyone is going at their own pace and has completely different priorities in life. Some people really want to leave with a relationship, some people are focused on getting a friend group, others put all their time into extracurriculars. You can‚Äôt do everything, and you do not have to juggle it all at once. Remember everyone else is in the same boat. 
12. Lastly, remember that everyone has a unique uni experience. It might not be what you expected, and it's okay to feel sad that you didn‚Äôt get everything you wanted out of it. But you should also appreciate the moments where you achieved things, or experienced things you never thought you would. 

Have the best 3 years here!

Cambridge grads often go on to achieve great things, whether it's in academia, industry, politics or otherwise. And then there's me, an unemployed femcel who lives in her parents' basement, catfishing her way to being a discord mod of an incel-laden server where people write NSFW Andy and Leyley fanfics. And I love it. I don't want that to change. Fuck the expectation to make a big impact on the world, I just want to be an unambitious degen forever. Bonus points if someone wants to be the Andy to my Leyley. I dream of having my own big brother to bitch around xx

now that I have graduated these are things I wish I heard when I was an undergraduate.

1. Get reading stuff that are not on the reading list not just for extra credit but for wider knowledge 
2. If you think a supervisor is a bit dodge chances are you are right. Don‚Äôt let that decide your experience with the paper. Supervisors are temporary, grades are unfortunately forever 
3.join any society that will take your mind off work. This is essential. 
4.keep a fairly busy schedule that includes non-negotiables like when you have lunch, hanging out with friends etc
5. Keep and re-read essay feedback even when it‚Äôs painful, there is some truth in most feedback 
6.make friends on your course and also make friends on OTHER courses
7.you must never be afraid to ask for help, it is rarely offered so freely at university
8. If you can secure notes and help from older years,do so promptly like in Michaelmas
9.work out why you are being taught said papers. They all have a purpose even if it doesn‚Äôt seem so. Also there is always a reason why a paper is compulsory, pay good attention you‚Äôll need it later.
10. have some long term goals beyond grades. You might not end up doing them but it certainly helps to motivate you.
11. Don‚Äôt bother with people who continually compare 
12. This is a hard one to say BUT if you feel that you must intermit. Do so, don‚Äôt worry about your friends graduating that isn‚Äôt the most important thing, you are :) 
P.S you‚Äôll be okay
13. try and get outside as much as possible 
14. Go to social events
15. Write for something else that isn‚Äôt your degree (very humanities directed) it really improves your writing 
16. Your opinions matter but in the context of what you have read so get reading 
17. You are allowed to say no and sit some things out.
18. keep in touch with someone outside of uni, they‚Äôll be a breath of fresh air
19. You can do absolutely anything if you really really wish, nothing is too good for you and no one is inherently better than you. Don‚Äôt let academics‚Äô opinions of your potential decide for you
20. Keep your head up. You are a Cambridge student, what a legend. 

Best of luck to you and all your endeavours and if you can complete this, then the world is most definitely your oyster!

Cambridge theatre is wonderful but it makes me feel so conflicted. Am I not getting a fair chance because I‚Äôm a racial minority, or am I just consistently bad? Are the people who get cast time and time again truly better than the rest of us? Do certain directors really make informal agreements with friends to cast them in shows beforehand, as the rumours say? Would appreciate if anyone has any insight to offer, because sometimes it does feel like a pointless endeavour and maybe it‚Äôs time to cut my losses and move on from trying to be involved in theatre.

Can someone please write an open letter about exam marking in humanities? There should not be regular instances of people getting the same questions marked 10-20 marks different between two examiners. Getting an average is not enough. Clearly one or both of those markers is/are wrong!! Departments need to make clearer marking criteria and ensure that all markers have the same idea of what constitutes each class. Yes, there is subjectivity in humanities, but markers should be open to new ideas, etc. and be able to give an accurate grade based on the standards of the faculty and not their own biases.

Are you a first-generation university student who did your undergraduate studies at Cambridge? I am a second-year PhD candidate at the Faculty of Education conducting a study about the sense of belonging among first-generation women students at Cambridge. I am looking for women from underrepresented backgrounds (e.g., state-school and BAME students) to discuss their experiences here. I also speak to their mothers to understand the family's support in their children's educational journeys. So far, I have interviewed very inspirational women, but I am struggling to find a couple more.

As a student parent with experiences overlapping both mothers and daughters participating in my research, I can relate to my participants on a personal level. This connection helps ensure that conversations, while in-depth, are relaxed and informal. Participants will be anonymised to ensure your privacy.

Please get in touch with amd218 if you did your undergrads at Cambridge in the 21st century. If you are still an undergrad but think you have something to say about belonging, please get in touch too.

Thank you!

I know this is incredibly bitter, but I can't stop being envious of people who perform worse than me academically and yet got into the nice colleges that rejected me when I applied, whilst I have to go to my pool college which has tangibly made my university experience so much worse.

Men of Cambridge Hinge,

I moved back to my home town for the summer, and adjusted my hinge location accordingly. I very quickly realised that the men in my home town are disappointing, to put it lightly. 
After a few days, I put my location back to Cambridge. Although I am not there physically, I am there in spirit. My aim is to turn my ‚Äúlikes‚Äù section into a waiting list of people I may or may not date upon my return in September.
HOWEVER. I have noticed an issue. The men who are liking me, and the men I am scrolling through, are mostly men attending other universities who are home in Cambridge for the summer, who will likely desert me when September rolls around. I understand that the lack of Cambridge students on Hinge is due to the fact that most of you have changed your locations to your hometowns for the summer‚Ä¶ I urge you to reconsider.

This whole post has been a public service announcement.

I'm so ambivalent about my degree, I chose it because I wasn't sure what else to do, and chose Cambridge because I supposed I was smart enough to apply. Now I'm here and just feel kinda guilty when I speak to subject friends who are super passionate and spend time over the summer reading and thinking about our degree topic, when I would easily go the rest of my life without touching the subject again. I haven't really got any job ambitions or ideas beyond the fact that I'd like to live comfortably, and neither do I have the motivation or quite frankly ability to do a super high powered if soulless corporate job. I'm just here. *shrugs*

Icl getting a bit sick of all the posts debating whether or not a 2.1 is a failure or not. It obviously isn't and you also didn't have to have major extenuating circumstances or come from an underprivileged background to make that degree impressive. Getting a 2.1 from the University of Cambridge in any tripos under any circumstances is a huge achievement! Please can we stop acting otherwise or that people have to have some excuse or reason why they didn't get a first to validate their 2.1

Reminder to all disabled students to complete the national disabled students survey (sent out by the ADRC). This is another chance to voice our critiques of the EAMC and any other issues of ableism at the uni. Despite it being a national survey instead of feedback to the uni, it goes against Cambridge's name. If we can't force change within the institution, we can demonstrate their reputation to the national survey. It's wishful thinking but why not try.

Dear diary,
It's been 3 days since we set off from Girton to Senate House. Rations are running low, incontinence is running high. The Praelector has become incoherent and the dirt accumulating on his gown is making him stumble. His gait grows weaker by the hour. We are running out of ways to pass the time. I think the others are starting to see through my attempts to discuss the ethics of cannibalism. What started as a joke is now becoming a source of fear and distrust among the pack. They will change their minds eventually one way or another.

To anyone feeling disappointed with their results or like they're struggling:
I went from top of my school for A-levels to feeling like I was going to fail 1st year. We didn't have exams because of COVID and I genuinely think that I would've failed if it wasn't for that. 2nd year was no better and I really thought I was going to do terribly for my entire degree. I didn't understand anything and was really struggling. Third year I came very bottom of the 2.1s, and in my fourth I ended up on a 2.2, and was disappointed. But I finally found something I enjoyed and was good at which I did for my project. My supervisor was still happy to take me for the PhD. Now I've just had my first paper accepted and I'm submitting a second one next week.
The point is, you might feel like you're failing now, like nothing's gonna work out and you're the stupidest person in your year. But people are genuinely right, things will get better. Just go out there and find what you're good at and what you enjoy. It doesn't matter what that is, whether it's academic, helping other people or just fun. Do what you feel passionate about and everything else will work itself out

Firstly you don‚Äôt know they all got firsts. I think you may be underestimating how many people are in the same position as you are in (or feel like you are in) but feel a pressure to keep up appearances for friends, family and to fit in. It‚Äôs totally normal to have very mixed feelings about graduation or even feel disappointed especially if you did not have a wholly positive time here but you said yourself you were very close to a First which any graduate program or employer will be impressed with especially as it is Cambridge. I‚Äôm in something of a similar position myself although not a finalist (high 2:1 given very extenuating circumstances which affected both academics and socialising when others were able to enjoy their time and work hard while I was completely in survival mode and my parents have no understanding for how it feels to feel like a ‚Äúfailure‚Äù even when you are objectively doing very well and my college has been dismal) so I fully understand that anything anyone says won‚Äôt take away from what you‚Äôre feeling deep down. BUT graduation is one day among many, and your degree is three years among many. You have your whole life ahead of you. To everyone on the outside looking in you are still an exceptionally high achiever so please please don‚Äôt beat yourself up. Sending love.

I got a 2.1 and felt like I'd failed  at Cam. I drifted for a couple of years but when I noticed a double starred first grad also wasnt in a 'career' I stopped the self destruction.

I didn't make lifelong friends at Cam and who says you have to? Why us a lifelong friend considered to be more important than a friend youvebonly known for a couple of years. I had people who I got on with really well at Cam and who I remain in touch with on some level. What I've learnt is that most people are in your life for periods of time and when you move on you meet new people who are just as nice but you have more in common with because you are at the same point. I've also become friends with people who I've met in my career who were at Cam when I was but I didn't like then. Its only reflection that allows me to see i wasted too much time on stuff that hasnt been an issue. Learn to enjoy the journey you are on.

Tw: mental health, depression

.
.
.

.
.
I just graduated and seeing everyone post their grad photos is making me super mega depressed. I can just tell they all got firsts and I got a 2.1 (super close to a first) which I already feel so shitty about that I didn't even want to go to graduation.
I'm also realising how many people from college met their best friends on matriculation and have stayed friends since - I feel like I'm leaving this place with 0 friends (don't get me wrong I do have people I call friends but I'm definitely not THEIR main friend). It's like the last 3 years were a massive waste because a) I didn't succeed academically and b) I didn't meet my future friends for life.

I feel more lonely now than I ever have and now being at home I have to deal with my parents who have NO understanding of mental health at all. Not sure I know how to be happy for everyone else when I feel so miserable - I know that makes me a horrible person but I just don't know what to do. I don't want to keep doing this over and over.

In response to #Camfession41070 Re: marking on exams
I'm currently a PhD student and have been involved in marking at other universities - we had double marking too but there was a threshold of disparity that was tolerated. If the disparity was greater than that the markers met and discussed and if they still disagreed a third marker was called to mark blindly and this was resolved with their intervention. The only downside can be that more senior academics tend to strong arm the junior... I would strongly urge you to start a formal issue regarding marking, involve your reps, your college, find sympathetic staff etc. They won't do anything unless there is a lot of pressure and it persists.

Saying that, however, I got a 2.1 (which I am actually very proud of) but it does feel like it pales in comparison to those of you celebrating firsts or topping tripos. Would love to post about it on LinkedIn but it seems like nothing in comparison :(

RE: Massive disparities in marking in this University?

Okay so I just got my notesheets back for my exams this year‚Ä¶ I did a certain paper which I was predicted a First on and had been doing well in supos in for the entire year. Then, on results day, I find out I got a 60 in said paper.

The next day, I requested my notesheets for said exam, and found this out (see pictures below). Since the exams for my course are double-marked, there are two notesheets. For the second question in particular, the first examiner gave me a 46 (a THIRD) and the second examiner gave me a 72 (a First) for the same question‚Ä¶ just how is this possible? How can one faculty have such stark disparities in marking? I have many questions and little answers as the Cambridge marking system is deemed so infallible ‚Äî through the double marking system ‚Äî that no appeals are allowed. Just want to post this to prove that Humanities marking in this University is, in some instances, completely arbitrary..

Please post in desperate need of graduation advice! 

It‚Äôs taken me some time to process but I found out today that I did not reach the Pass Mark for my third and final year. There‚Äôs been extenuating circumstances that I was dealing with during the two week period in which a dissertation and another piece of coursework were due in that were significantly affected as a result. I just don‚Äôt know what to do - does not passing third year mean I don‚Äôt get to graduate despite getting a 2.1 in second year? 

(In 3/5 of my exams this year I received 2.1 marks individually) 

I can find literally zero information on what happens when you don‚Äôt pass final year and it‚Äôs especially stressful when only 48 hours before I‚Äôm meant to graduate my results are being released. (Curse the History department) 

I‚Äôm just really panicking and unsure of what to do. If anyone has any experience I‚Äôd appreciate advice! 

(There is obviously a lot more to the extenuating circumstances than described but for the sake of anonymity I‚Äôd rather keep that private)

CN: anxiety, insecurities.........

Tw: depression, anxiety 

Really struggling atm. Had a falling out with a really good friend a couple weeks ago where he suddenly blocked me mid-argument and I'm really struggling to bounce back. I have a hard, brash exterior so really struggle letting people in but we became friends really quickly and he was a major part of me recovering from a lot of mental health issues and we really bonded. However my insecurities would always get the better of me; I suffer from abandonment issues due to past friendships and relationships and I ended up ruining this friendship by carrying those anxieties. Similarly because I felt he was so much better than me I tried to overcompensate too much and became overly needy and needing to feel validated and I know that drove him away. My graduation is in a few days but I couldn't be any less excited. I'm crying myself to sleep most nights and as much as I try to distract myself, I keep beating myself over what I could've done differently to not lose him as a friend. I'm really dreading these next few weeks? Any advice on how I can move past these feelings so it doesn't ruin my summer?

this is a particular message to graduands. 

you have done so well! Far better than any number can articulate. You have pushed through all sorts of days and come out the end! Give yourself a massive well done. I‚Äôd like to remind you that you are on your own journey, your own little race and you just crossed a finish line. That is so amazing! It is hard to see the bigger picture sometimes but in a couple of years time you probably will. I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs okay to feel delighted or down about it but don‚Äôt ever say you didn‚Äôt accomplish anything. YOU ARE A A GRADUATE FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE. Congratulations!! Sending you lots of hugs.

Hi, I've broken into five balls over two years. Here's how I rationalize it. 

The main reason I crash balls is for the plot. It's a story to tell, and I want to party with my friends. I was thinking this year that maybe I wouldn't eat or drink once I was in, but then I was there and the food looked so good and it didn't feel like it mattered that much. I didn't drink much though. 

I think most people find it cool, but a large minority look down on it like you. Which is totally fair, it's absolutely selfish. I want to spin it as a form of protest against a tradition that pressures people to waste their money on gross excess, but that wasn't my intention. 

I would rather not attend the balls than pay to attend. And if I was caught I would have happily left and probably been glad to get to bed.

Personally, the other big reason why I sneak in is because I feel too insecure in my friendships to make big plans way ahead of time like that. But if I can sneak in then it's sort of an excuse to invite myself along.

I'm also autistic, and I loved Darwin may ball and I think the committee did really well. I know it was fairly loud everywhere, but the silent disco started quite early on, reducing noise levels, and the fact that it was difficult to have quieter areas is simply a limitation of Darwin's geography, being a smaller college in a way that John's does not struggle with. I honestly think the committee did the best they could with the resources available to them.

I know autistic voices can often be overlooked, but that also doesn't mean we are all sidelined and share the same opinion on everything.

Everyone‚Äôs talking about how some May/June events had no quiet areas, but we also need to talk about some people‚Äôs treatment of quiet areas where they were present.

I‚Äôve never seen so many people screaming, yelling, and generally using ‚Äúquiet‚Äù areas as though they were their own living rooms/bedrooms. That‚Äôs not what they‚Äôre intended for, and your loud behaviour makes them entirely unsuitable for the people who do need them the most (e.g. those prone to sensory overloads).

If we are going to call for accessible quiet areas can we please make sure they actually stay quiet and accessible?

I didn‚Äôt want to write this but saw the post tagged above and I want autistic voices to finally be heard! 

As a disabled person I cannot disagree more, Darwin Ball is really not great. I am autistic. There was no variety in food (only fastfoods) and drinks (the cocktail options were very limited) options but the worst part was all the activities were very loud, even the supposedly quiet ones were not isolated - they all looked like they were organised by one person to their personal liking without considering others. And for the record I went to St John‚Äôs last year and I did not have this problem. People responsible for entertainment here were obviously not in consultation with disability team and did not consider the needs (and honestly also tastes) of people other than themselves. All the colleges just talk about being inclusive but when it comes to acting they only cater for non-disabled people. Sorry for this rant but I am so pissed at this.

As a fresher the amount of crashers at may balls has really shocked me and I am genuinely confused to why people do it (open to answers). 
Seperate to people who cannot afford balls, people who have attended and paid for other balls in may week crashing the later balls has just really confused me? What is the need? Why do they have a right to crash these balls and enjoy them, meanwhile the experiences people who have paid ¬£150+ are impacted, with food and drink running out quicker and causing extra stress for all staff and committee members due to the security risk of people who haven‚Äôt been checked. 
Committee members have been working on the ball for at least 6 months, people have paid their own money to be there, so why do people who have not paid out of choice deserve this experience and why is this not more criticised?

Little John had been saving up pickup garbage on Kings Parade for 9 years now he can afford to build a Cambridge college with his wife and 1,000,000 kids. 

First of all, he welded a frame with Galvanised Square Steel‚Ñ¢ and screwed in place with screws he borrowed from his Aunt. He covered the frame in Eco Friendly Wood Veneer‚Ñ¢ and Cement durable for 10,000 years. He installed a college bar for added relaxation and spirited discussion good for expanding wisdom for the future generations.

He installed a modernist chapel to honour ancestors and bring peace and harmony to the college with college choir singing. Lastly, he built a self-service hall for wonderment and satisfaction to the undergraduates.

Now let's look at the overall effect:

I don't know if this an odd thing to say or not but as someone who is rather sensitive to scents I love smelling all the wonderful perfumes that people put on especially for May Balls!! If it's an expensive one that you ONLY get out for special occasions, or just a higher dosage of your daily perfume, I love it! I ran into a gorgeous lady in my corridor a few nights ago and was hit by a cloud of her exquisite perfume and it was lovely! It actually lingered in the corridor for quite a while, which was a welcome change to the normal, semi-rubbery scent of the corridor

TL;DR yall smell nice :)

AITA: My boyfriend is a walking green flag but he‚Äôs dead set on joining the drinking society next year and I‚Äôm worried it will be a bad influence on him and give us less time together ://

He‚Äôs very sporty so is already friends with lots of the football guys in the society but unlike his other friends who seem like nice and trustworthy people, these drinking soc boys are known to be pretty rowdy, obnoxious and treat women poorly. I don‚Äôt understand why he wants their validation when he already has a very active social life and I‚Äôm worried that that culture of binge drinking and peer pressure to ‚Äòbe the big man‚Äô will make him act differently. 

Also, we‚Äôre both going into our final years next year and he‚Äôs already expressed concerns about how he‚Äôs going to manage his degree work with sport, and various committees, and seeing his normal friends, and now the drinking soc events (not to mention seeing me lol). I don‚Äôt see how this extra social commitment won‚Äôt eat into our already limited time together in a busy Cambridge term. He‚Äôs planning to do the initiation next term - is it ok that I‚Äôm trying to talk him out of it? I strongly disagree with drinking socs and his being involved with them but I don‚Äôt want to be controlling or tell him how to live his life. I doubt I‚Äôd break up with him over it but I really really don‚Äôt want to spend the next year hearing about him being a chundering public nuisance along with a bunch of misogynistic rowers and rugby boys

Why is St John‚Äôs Voices really being shut down? It is a very successful choir and provides opportunities for female singers of all vocal types, while the main college choir does not include sopranos, limiting opportunities for women. Indeed, there is currently only one female singer in St John‚Äôs College Choir. 
The statement put out by John‚Äôs regarding music in the college (https://www.joh.cam.ac.uk/music-college-st-johns-statement) implies SJV is sucking up resources which could instead be used for more accessible music opportunities including ‚Äòmasterclasses in music, for example on song writing‚Äô and supporting ‚Äònew opportunities for non-auditioned singing‚Äô. The implication seems to be that SJV is somehow elitist. Additionally, the statement claims ‚ÄòStudents‚Äô preferences and experiences in music today are different from those of previous generations, and many of them have had fewer musical opportunities in school than might have been the case in the past.‚Äô This implies SJV essentially is being scrapped because state schools are failing to provide music opportunities and training to pupils. This is pretty sad and illogical if true.
Additionally, the college stresses in the statement the ‚Äòsignificant resources currently devoted to St John‚Äôs Voices‚Äô, but I wonder how much the choir really costs to run. The whole move to scrap SJV seems rather underhanded and I don‚Äôt see why a high-level choir like SJV cannot coexist with more accessible music opportunities, especially in a college as rich as St John‚Äôs. 
By the way, I am not a member of SJV, I am just confused about why the choir apparently needs to be scrapped.
Here is a link to the petition to save SJV: https://www.change.org/p/save-st-john-s-voices-stop-cutting-opportunities-for-female-singers-in-cambridge

Hotter take: May Balls are immoral.
I don't mean attendees or organisers are individually immoral. It's the system.
More specifically, May Balls are problematic because:
- they bring private security guards into people's homes (remember college is some people's year-round home)
- they kick students out of their rooms (shoutout to colleges that don't do this)
- they generate large amounts of waste (even compostable packaging still generally ends up in landfill)
- they cement and make obvious Cambridge's gaping class divide
- they foster a collective delusion that ¬£100+ is a reasonable amount to pay for one night. At any other university in the UK minus Oxford, students would rightly wince at an event over ¬£50
- the noise
If you quietly agree with this but feel like everyone's going to a ball, rest assured you're not alone! So many students don't, and never, go to the balls, and instead have delightful May Weeks year-after-year at the free or reasonably priced events, hanging out with friends, working on the causes they believe in, and/or making the most of the beauty of Cambridge in the sunshine.

Cutting the queue at may balls is perhaps the ultimate test of the character of a Cambridge student:

-Anyone can do it, fairly easily, and knows they probably won't get ejected or turned around. The worst that can happen is someone arguing with them, which rarely happens and wouldn't force them back anyway. This would be different if colleges enforced this with actual consequences, but they tend not to.
-It's easy to do mental gymnastics to justify it ("Somebody else did it", "I had a reason for being late", "It's not that deep", "This one person I technically know is standing near where I cut in"). These are bullshit and don't need to be refuted, but since some of the people reading this are said queue-cutters, I'll point out that you could just as well go BACK in the queue to join your friends (I do this when necessary), or even (nobody does this) both move to the middle of your two locations, both of which would be much less disrespectful to those around you. Additionally, any amount of "deep" or "not that deep" that "it" is equally describes the impact to you of just joining the queue like a normal person.
-The consequences of cutting the queue are plainly visible: everyone who's being inconvenienced is standing right there. You could even count them if you felt like it. 
-It's well-known that (unless you bought a queue jump or dining ticket or something, in which case you wouldn't be there anyway) everybody paid the same amount and has the exact same goal. Any particular justification the queue-cutter makes up doubtless applies to quite a few people behind them who haven't cut.
-The queue-cutter's behavior relies entirely on other people being less selfish and not just cutting in front of them later. It is possible only because the person who does it is more selfish than their peers.
-Everyone had the exact same opportunity to show up whenever they pleased and join the queue. There was no random or favoristic allocation of queue positions.
-Finally, cutting the queue is plainly visible (and annoying) to all the people waiting. There is no way to hide or misrepresent the behaviour to onlookers, making those who do it truly impervious to both internal conscience and external judgement.

On further thought, this isn't *just* a reflection on a given student's character, but on the fact that they live a life either by privilege or by chosen associations where they're protected from social consequences for being a dick. I thought about ending this with "Do better.", but I have no hope, so I'll just stop here.

I imagine I can't be the only one that feels a bit uncomfortable about the use of live animals for May Week entertainment. I really enjoyed Newnham Garden Party on the whole and thought it was well-planned overall with good music, drinks, and atmosphere, but my experience was somewhat soured by seeing the owls that were tethered in an area on one of the lawns. One of them was tethered directly in the bright sun, which was so blazing this afternoon that I had to look for shade after 30 minutes in it started to make me feel faint. I can't imagine how that would affect the sensitive eyes of a creature adapted to live in the darkness. The owls were also all surrounded by students, who did their best to be respectful as far as I saw but did get quite close to get photos sometimes and were naturally having fun (as they should be!) so were sometimes a bit tipsy and having loud conversations, not to mention the noise from the main band across the garden. One of the birds looked visibly distressed at points, but the keeper was busy with a queue of students waiting to take photos with the owls on their arms and didn't check on the tethered birds once that I could see in the 30 minutes I was there. I don't think it's anyone's fault who attended the event, who wouldn't have intended any harm, but owls are nocturnal creatures that prefer quiet environments and a loud, sunny, garden party seems like it would naturally make them stressed and unhappy. I've seen owls at a formal event in Cambridge before, but this was after dark, they were in a courtyard that was much quieter, and they were always under the keepers' supervision, so I wasn't left with the same worries and the birds seemed, as far as I could tell, more relaxed.

I know committees are trying their best but please ensure you're upfront and fair with your workers about hours involved and hourly compensation. Don't advertise ¬£13 for 10 hours then request us to attend unpaid training and turn up (again, unpaid) half an hour before our contract start time; advertise the role for what it is: ¬£11.30 for 11.5h. Just 1.5 extra hours drops the ¬£13 hourly compensation (a "competitive" rate) to below minimum wage. 

Workers: you have the right to query demands which weren't specified in your contract and to demand minimum wage for your hours worked (including training). The more people kick up a fuss (even just an email!), the harder it is for committees to be ignorant of their oversights. 

Furthermore, I hope it wouldn't be outrageous to expect that under-21 year olds be compensated with the living wage for ALL hours worked, INCLUDING training hours.

Let people enjoy may week in peace !!! It sucks when you can't afford to do something fun, (as a state school free school meal kid I am very acutely aware of this) but making every other post on here into a guilt piece is unnecessary imo. There's loads of cheap/free events in may week that I have enjoyed far more than the ball I've been too, and letting loose with your friends is the best part of all of it. Let and let live, its not any students fault that you can't go to a certain event so stop making it out like people should have fun in secret.

Hot take: Sneaking into May Balls is immoral.

Yeah yeah I can already feel the ü§ì emojis in the comments.

May Balls make 0 profit. Every single expense must be raised through ticket sales. 

Ask anyone who has worked on a May Ball committee, security to stop people from sneaking in is hugely expensive. This must be covered by increasing ticket prices. All the food, drink, and NME events consumed by people who snuck in must be covered by increasing ticket prices. 

There is no way around this. May Balls break even, so paying customers must cover the losses incurred by those who haven't paid. The ONLY thing for which this is not true are the musicians, as consumption is non-rivalrous, yet even here people who sneak in free-ride. It is therefore the case that students who sneak in directly cost other students money. 

I really do not understand why this point is not made more often. I know multiple people who complain about high ticket prices making Balls inaccessible for lower income students, who then do everything they can to keep ticket prices high by attempting to sneak into every Ball!

I think its probably because students are so used to events being ran by profit-making companies which can firm the costs that they then translate this mindset over to the non-profit May Balls. Either that, or people are too afraid of being seen as 'lame' by criticising the practice. 

I see it as akin to as if half the students within your college simply shoplifted all their meals from the dining hall, and so prices had to be increased for those who still pay. You are costing fellow students money!!!!!! Please can we stop doing this!!!!

Have you ever been told that you are 'colour blind' but feel you can discriminate red and green reasonably well? 

We are seeking participants for a study of variant forms of colour perception.

Our experiments involve judging colours presented briefly on a screen.

We offer a compensation at the rate of ¬£14 per hour (and we'll be able to tell you more about your own form of colour perception.) 

There's an initial screening session of less than 30 minutes and then two further sessions taking about an hour each.

If you can help, please contact: 

Amelia Burrell: ab2807@cam.ac.uk
Anaha Nakkeeran: an666@cam.ac.uk

Funny thing is this is the first year that changed this policy (previously graduated students can stay until late August with normal rates) WITHOUT EXTRA NOTICE and they wrote to me "I wish you had emailed us in advance..." Like come on, you just want to make more money just admit it.

I've recently found out that one of my friends is still spending a lot of time with my ex. When we broke up, this person was really awful to me to the point I was having panic attacks and nightmares about what he might do, and I know if someone had treated one of my friends like that I wouldn't speak to the ex again or interact with them. I know I can't control who people are friends with and I'm not sure if I'm overreacting or not but its a bit of a kick in the teeth that this person is still hanging out with someone who still terrifies me.

CN: toxic family, child abuse, PTSD
.

Am unfortunately in the exact position you‚Äôve described - I grew up with normalised abuse and intermitted early Michaelmas due to extreme pressure from family to drop out. There weren‚Äôt any academic/health reasons so put it down as MH for the EAMC (not entirely untrue as the family situation had aggravated a lot of cPTSD stuff that I was previously managing). Returning to the abuse felt like the path of least resistance but was the absolute worst thing for my MH & wellbeing. 

None of my friends at Cam would think this was the case - I seem entirely self sufficient and financially could walk away from the situation, but have found it really hard to extract myself emotionally. I‚Äôm too embarrassed and frustrated with myself to be honest with anyone about it. 

I have had the worst year of my life. The only light at the end of the tunnel has been returning to Cam to escape from it all, but I‚Äôm running low on hope. I wish I had some advice to give you.

CN: classism

I know this isn‚Äôt exactly a new take, as I‚Äôm sure there have been numerous camfesses that say similar things, but I have genuinely been so disappointed by the levels of classism and elitism that I have witnessed at this university. I have heard even day to day conversations that jokingly patronise and mock those from lower class backgrounds, though often implicitly, or those who those who have not come from traditionally privileged families. That‚Äôs without addressing the intrinsic divide created by institutions such as drinking societies that benefit, generally, those who are conventionally attractive or from certain backgrounds. I know it all sounds so obvious, but I am sick of certain groups of students at this university portraying that they are better than others who either are not as privileged as they are and so can‚Äôt keep up with their ‚Äòprivate school-esque banter‚Äô, or not so ostentatious so that they are perceived by them as irrelevant. To make it completely clear, being a member of a drinking society or a certain kind of social group at this university makes you absolutely no better than any other person here- just because you fall into a part of the social system at this university that lifts you up just because you (often, though not always) happen to come from a certain background that gives you 'good enough chat' that you‚Äôre considered acceptable, that is by no means any achievement. There are some incredibly impressive, lovely people at this university that slip through the cracks and are mocked by other groups simply because they don‚Äôt fit their exact mould of acceptability. And it‚Äôs far from an exaggeration- I have heard so many conversations that put down such people and where those involved lift each other up out of nothing other than wanting a reason to feel superior but due to no real work or achievement of their own- only the type of school they went to or culture they happen to have been exposed to. To be clear, I don‚Äôt mean in terms of academics and do truly believe everyone here academically deserves to be so from what I have seen, but what I refer to is rather the culture of elitism among some.

Absolutely disgusted by the behaviour displayed at the annual French society dinner. Whilst the president of the society welcomed everyone by saying that it was a society designed for people 'from the francophone world and lovers of it', they proceeded to give a history professor the space to celebrate the 1763 Treaty of Paris that was designed to divide up colonial territories between England and France. The professor said casually that 'anyone who is sensitive should leave the room now' and proceeded to describe the nature of the treaty before moving swiftly on to toast 'to peace' between the two nations. A black student, visibly upset, stood up and left the room during the speech. People next to me SMIRKED at this. I cannot imagine how they must have felt in that moment and I cannot believe that despite Cambridge preaching it is inclusive, this institution continues to provide spaces for people to bring up and CELEBRATE painful, violent histories in a totally inappropriate setting and manner. A lot of people were visibly uncomfortable and we had to pay ¬£50 for the privilege. My only regret (apart from going to this dinner in the first place) is that I did not stand up and leave the room with the student in solidarity. Shame on all of us that didn't have the guts to stand up and walk out.

A periodic help post on writing statements for job applications ‚Äì my personal system which has netted three interviews and two longlists in the last three weeks. NB this is entirely a personal experience, one that works for me. Results are often not instant, and you‚Äôll likely go through several applications before finding your own personal approach and voice.

One thing to note is that the job market is variable. External events dictate recruitment. I have seen a slowdown, repeated by contacts I have in the job agencies, which is a combination of the budget-setting process within companies and organisations, as well as a collective holding of breath due to the election and knock-on effects.
All experience is useful, what you may consider as a trifling activity can be turned into a demonstration of your planning and critical thinking. Look at your hobbies and sports. Even if you are a solo hobbyist or sportsperson, your preparations, research and planning will be a source of evidence. When I was in the Reserves, I saw a colleague present on the making of a perfect jam sandwich as part of the promotion board. He discussed equipment (plate, knife), ingredient quality (fresh bread, which jams are good), appropriate quantities (resource management) and ratio of bread, jam and butter, as well as storage solutions (fridge, Tupperware, etc.). 

‚Ä¢ DO read the personal specs. My partner and I have both sifted job applicants and we have both seen copy and paste applications, including irrelevant waffle, response to non-existent specs (clearly from another job) the name of a different company in the application. If you are not that bothered about the details, we‚Äôre not that bothered about you. 

For a longlist, we will be skim-reading your application for key words and will likely have our own tick list. There will be a few stellar applications, some borderline maybes, mostly average applications, and some stinkers. For a shortlisting, a common practice is to score a candidate against each person spec with a 0, 1 or 2. 0 = no evidence, 1 = some evidence or tangential evidence, 2 = a spot-on evidenced response to that criterion. The applications are ranked accordingly, and the borderline candidates discussed. Usually, two or more people are involved to minimise bias and subjectivity, but not always.  Some companies will use AI and word counters. Personally, I prefer eyeballing it to catch any useful context.

‚Ä¢ DO answer each spec with some evidence. For example, nearly all specs call for an experienced user of Microsoft Office. I once led a team-level upgrade to Office 365 so I mention that. If you haven‚Äôt got a work-related example, consider when you have used Office programmes, e.g. for writing and presentation, data manipulation and storage. I do add other programmes such as Google Suite and some bespoke software that I use. It is also worth mentioning any programming skills (IMHO) briefly if they are not asked for. 

‚Ä¢ DO use similar language to the person spec. You will soon get a feel for which personal specs have been thought out and which ones are generic waffle. Generic specs are not an excuse for a generic answer. Your evidencing becomes even more vital at this stage. 

‚Ä¢ Personally, I write out each statement from scratch, but I have saved previous statements as they provide a useful turn of phrase to reference. This pushes me to consider the context in the current application without blindly trusting past-me to have crafted a perfect sentence. Regard them as inspiration, not a cut and paste option.

‚Ä¢ Save your personal statements with a clear naming system. Also save a download or screenshot of the job vacancy, further particulars, etc. It is difficult to recall the nuances of the job spec once that advert disappears form the internet. 

‚Ä¢ Read the employer‚Äôs website, search for their value statements. Reflect those values in your statement in a way that it is natural that you too share those values through how you present your examples. This is appropriate for those Person Specs that are personal ‚Äì e.g. flexible, positive, team-player, etc.

‚Ä¢ Once you have a bare-bone statement based on the person spec, re-read the job spec and expectations of the role. Doing this after writing your statement, you will be more alert to the language they are using to describe the job. You can edit your statement accordingly, as ell as spot any regular tasks not included in the person spec that you can acknowledge in your statement. For example, one of my recent applications had event management in the job description but not the person spec. Instead of writing out additional responses to a perceived spec, I ensured that one of my evidence responses drew from my event management experience. This is also an opportunity to nuance your language to that of the job spec. 

‚Ä¢ DO maintain a bank of answers you have used the STAR method for. Two paragraphs is about what you should aim for as a crib for interviews, with a one-two sentence summary for the statement.
(S)ituation ‚Äì a succinct explanation of the background to your example. Who you were working with. What was the objective and the challenge. Where and When this was. Why were you doing this. 
(T)ask. This is where you explain what YOU were asked or decided to do. Avoid the trap of talking about the team. The employer wants to see the value you added.
(A)ction. How did you carry out your task? What did you consider beforehand? 
(R)esult. How did your contribution affect the result? Success can be both productive (you ensured the catering for an event went smoothly) as well as preventative (You stopped an event becoming a disaster).

‚Ä¢ Maintain a healthy approach to time management for applying for jobs. Treat it as a job in of itself. Otherwise you will find things become wearisome and depressing. Keep up your meal times, rest, hobbies and exercise. Do not leave applications to the last minute, many roles in the private sector in particular state that they will close early if they receive a certain volume. 

‚Ä¢ DO get coaching help, from the Careers Service, relatives, and online. There are CV services that will provide a basic report with the hope you will pay for the professional version. I have found them useful at the expense of some spam advertising of their paid services. TopCV and Belbin come to mind. Keep an eye out for free advice surgeries at careers fairs. There are regular quarterly fairs in Cambridge independent of the University. Team up with a few friends and discuss your experiences as you are applying, read each other‚Äôs application statements and the job specs to see if there‚Äôs something a fresh pair of eyes can spot. Champion each other and cheer each other on to success.

‚Ä¢ DO NOT despair at the knockbacks. You probably are a great fit for the role you have applied for, but you are up against dozens to hundreds of candidates at the sift stage. Your application is primarily to get through the sift process and it will come down to nuances of other candidates having that bit more of an edge, that bit more of a turn of phrase. At some point you will be that candidate.

In case you needed a reminder of how good your work is and how harsh Cambridge is, here's a comment from last year's external sociology examiner: 
You are producing a culture of hedging in the assessment process by not being bolder in your academic judgements. Some of the work I‚Äôve read is the best I‚Äôve seen in 35 years as a university teacher and yet you rarely grade over 75.

From a straight guy's perspective, one thing that never fails to move me, however many times it's happened, is when someone I'm going out with makes an effort with their outfit. It doesn't have to be anything over the top, just any amount of effort is so unbelievably flattering, the idea that someone actually decided to dress up just for me. It might look like I'm keeping a straight face but I am in fact squealing with excitement internally. Drives me mad. Just the best feeling in the world.

However I am currently sitting my finals and am so incredibly stressed and need to prioritise myself, but my friend is constantly messaging saying they're stressed/lonely/asking to hang out and I literally dont have the energy to even respond never mind actually support them rn. I don't know how to be a good friend and not piss them off whilst also doing well in my exams and treating myself well. any advice would be so useful

Hello!

(this applies to all non Labour/Tory parties, I'm using Greens as example :) )

1. If you're voting in Cambridge, Labour will win whether you vote Green or Labour, so you may as well vote Green.
2. Tactical voting is only a thing because of our voting system, and Labour oppose changing the voting system, so voting 'tactically' for Labour gives them a mandate to keep things as they are.
3. All Opposition parties actually get some funding depending on how many votes they get across the country, so e.g. every vote for the Greens funds staffing and research costs for the Green MPs that do get elected. Read more here: https://www.bbc.co.uk/.../uk-scotland-scotland-politics...
4. Higher vote share = greater media coverage.
5. More 2nd places for Greens this time means more viable seats to contest seriously at the next General Election, especially as Labour will be in government and so far fewer people will feel the need to vote tactically.
6. If you're looking at tactical voting sites, just be cautious that many of them use very lazy methodologies and/or recommend voting tactically even in very safe seats where it is not necessary nor helpful.

since drinking socs clearly suffer from a bias towards rich, white and attractive people, i think it would be interesting to see what happens if you open them up to the entire college community so that anyone who wants to join can join, rather than working through a 'tap on the shoulder' system. i genuinely challenge drinking soc presidents to try this. 

its just a society after all its literally in the name. surely no one would feel threatened if these societies were made less exclusive?

If you do nothing else in the runup to the General election, ask your candidates to support a PBSA regulator and big legal sanctions for property companies who invade the privacy of students and refuse to carry out repairs in halls. 

Invasion of privacy had a huge negative impact when living in Purpose Built Student Accommodation, which was compounded and made worse by having no-one to complain to - no statutory complaints procedure, only a voluntary code of conduct and the council's Private Housing standards weren't bothered either. 

Ask your candidates to support a PBSA regulator with powers to hand out huge fines for invasion of privacy and not carrying out repairs.

So i‚Äôm a finalist and i‚Äôve been really struggling with friendships recently. I‚Äôve never had one large friend group where everyone is friends with each other, i‚Äôve always had a few friends that don‚Äôt really know each other so i‚Äôve always done things with separate friends individually, which is not a problem. But sometimes, especially with people getting sprayed and congratulated after exams, i feel like i should have a friend ‚Äúgroup‚Äù by now? Like I don‚Äôt even know if any of my friends are going to come and congratulate me when i finish my exams because none of them talk to each other? Also on this, i feel like all of my friends have their own friend groups separate from me who they will live with or something so I‚Äôm never in the loop with their plans or anything that they‚Äôre doing because it‚Äôs when they‚Äôre with their ‚Äúmain‚Äù friends.
I just feel like i can never truly be great friends with someone unless I‚Äôm in their friendship group and icl it sucks. 
I don‚Äôt really know what i‚Äôm asking for or if i even want to do anything, I just needed somewhere to vent.

Guys, in genuine need for an opinion... so I have this old friend from literally since we were very young, we have helped each other (gone lengths helping each other), shared each other stuff we've told no one else, including our partners BUT (of course there is a BUT) he has this habit of just disapperaing for a few months, resurfaceing out of nowhere, our friendship grows closer than ever and the cycle continues. This time, it has been over an year (his record so far was nearly 4 months) and to be fair I am pissed. So far I have excused him (my mistake) because his coming back to my life has always been in moments when I've needed reassurance the most and I always preferred a helping hand/shoulder to cry on/person to laugh with than being mad. I love this person and the need to carry for him like no one else. Obivously, the right solution is drawing the line, be it cutting ties with him once and for all or expressing my anger with him when he decides it's time to contact me again. I don't want to loose him, but probs loosing him is healthier for me? What's your take on this? Oh and yes, we had a failed romance a few years ago, that for me has eroded all the romantic feelings, but none of my loyalty. Ps sorry for all the punctuation mistakes, cba xx

Honestly, nothing that kier starmer or labour does or announces these days aligns with my beliefs and the greens are much more who I would like to vote for in the GE. However, ultimately, I just want the tories out, and to me even though labour has some huge issues they are still better than the tories. Is a vote for anyone that isn‚Äôt labour a ‚Äòwasted‚Äô vote? Ideally there‚Äôd be a labour & greens coalition but how likely is that?

I hate the same self-righteous bollocks every person who runs for union president spouts- "ooh I'm going to change the union", "ooh im going to save democracy". No you're not, you want something fancy to put on your cv to lure in job offers from investment banking companies. No one outside your bubble cares about the union, there's real issues going on in the world. Put your energy into something useful. You're not Rosseau, you're Boris Johnson in a furry suit.

Something I remember so vividly from my year 2 teacher that still helps me today: when marking our homework, she never put a cross next to incorrect answers, because they weren‚Äôt wrong, they just weren‚Äôt right yet. She‚Äôd give us back our work and then give us the opportunity to do the questions again and get that tick (each tick in our workbooks were a point and 5 points was a sticker and if the whole class got enough stickers we‚Äôd get an iced bun party). Basically, the point is if you‚Äôve gotten stuff wrong in the past and think that‚Äôll happen in your exams when it rly matters, it‚Äôs not necessarily the case, it just that at that time it wasn‚Äôt right yet, and you will be able to get it right at some point and win that iced bun party!!!!

i just need to vent a little, and this isnt a comment about the whole situation but just the way its affected me. im someone who has struggled to embrace my ethnic identity (arab) over my time in cam and i was really looking forward to wearing my national dress to a may ball this year but i think i cant because of the way the iconography of the outfit (keffiyeh in particular) has been subsumed within the dialogue about this conflict. i see white people everywhere wearing elements of my dress as a political statement and i just know that if i do wear it at an event i'll just be grilled on my views (this has happened before when people find out that im an arab/see me wearing it) and i just want to enjoy the event instead of becoming a prop in other people's activism. i don't really have a point to make besides asking that people respect the individuality of people like me (and ive heard similar accounts from Jewish friends) rather than treating me as a sort of ethnic prop

I miss dating older men. 

I‚Äôm an undergraduate who has this year gotten into a habit of dating men way too old for me. I don‚Äôt mean men in their late 20s, rather men in their late 30s and early 40s. I realise their intentions for dating me were far from honourable but honestly I enjoyed it so much. I never had to worry about planning a date, they were very chivalrous and treated me with lots of respect, not to mention they paid for luxurious meals, shopping and activities. I don‚Äôt necessarily need to be paid for but it was such a nice gesture and made me feel taken care of. 

Well anyway, I stopped this habit after finding out a guy I was seeing was married and hadn‚Äôt told me. My friends were thrilled to say the least. But it is so frustrating dating men my own age and feels like a waste of my time.

I‚Äôve tried dating in my age range and have to say the past couple of dates I had were a disaster. Firstly, I absolutely HATE when a guy asks for your Snapchat, that app should have been left behind in middle school but for some reason adults still think it‚Äôs ok to use it. And the 3 am ‚Äúwyd‚Äù texts really put the nail in the coffin. Then there‚Äôs planning the dates, which so many guys our age can‚Äôt seem to do. So I always have to come up with a plan which I then have to double text the guy to confirm with. Finally the type of conversations I have with younger guys have just been so shallow. The one that stands out to me is when I went on a date and a guy asked me out of the blue whether I was ‚Äúdominant or submissive‚Äù because he couldn‚Äôt hold a conversation regarding anything else. Actually gross. 

Just to clarify, before anyone gets offended, I‚Äôm not suggesting all guys in their teens/early twenties are like this, but it‚Äôs a pattern I‚Äôve noticed. My solution has been to step out of the dating world entirely, because it just seems like a massive waste of my time. Anyway, that‚Äôs my rant. Best of luck to everyone with their exams (which I should‚Äôve been focusing on instead of writing this)

This has been an ongoing issue, but what the actual f is up with those Homerton catering people? They are so defensive about not serving breakfast after 9 o'clock and enjoy telling off students who are still there just because they had to wait in the queue. Some items are usually gone by 9 and they won't be bothered to make more because it is 9. I wonder how they come up with their own brekkie then. They literally RUN to close and lock the door at 9 to prevent any latecomers from having their meal, but they are tortoise-slow to serve meals. If they really have an issue with overworking, they should sort out their contract with the college instead of letting it all out to the students, who might be just putting up with it so that they make no fuss, get the degree, and get the f out of here.

The worst part of doing an "easy" Humanities degree is the pressure to get a 1 when over 90% of the cohort will get a 2:1 or higher. When almost the entire year group receives one of 2 grades, it feels less like a marker of achievement and more like separating the top 25% from 'the rest of us'. I'm always being told by friends in stem subjects that I don't need to work that hard to get a 2:1 because I do humanities, whilst they have to work 8+ hour days as a bare minimum for a Natsci or Eng 2:1. But when the 2:1 grading is so (comparatively) generous, and internships and postgrad places are so much scarcer, the only way to differentiate yourself (in applications, for example) is by having a 1, unlike stem who are practically guaranteed MSci places if they get a good 2:1. It's so frustrating being at the 2:1/1 boundary and knowing that all the extra work that separates the 25th percentile and the 90th percentile is negated by this huge grade range :/

To everyone worrying about exams, I find it helpful to remember that these papers are literally designed to test the best of the best people in the country. They are really hard and it can feel demoralising, but I find it helpful to remember that the reason they are so hard is because everyone here is so good. This is not meant to play down how stressful Cambridge can be, just a gentle reminder to not be too harsh on yourself!

Meanwhile as an international student (not the rich kind, the scholarship from a developing country kind) we have no such an option - if we don‚Äôt have anything lined up we have to leave this country and getting back here on a working visa would be 100 times harder, not to mention not working for several months means no roof over my head and food in my mouth. I wish I had a comfort of just taking half a year break to rest after four years of uni, but that‚Äôs not an option for many of us. I wish more people realised that and the privilege it is to have a gap year without suffering severe consequences.

Re #Camfession40621

This is a horrendous post and an unforgivable take for so many reasons: 

1: I refuse to believe that you have the financial capacity to buy a ticket to a MAY BALL, which is a lavish one-time event, but then refuse to invest, what, ¬£40-50 extra for a dress you can use numerous times? Work at another May Ball, at your college, or over the holidays if you need this small extra amount of cash.

2: Shein are a hideous company that use what is essentially slave labour to manufacture their clothes. Look up footage of their factories. There is no excuse to use their company, just like Temu, just like Gap, just like H&M. Not sure if you‚Äôre just naive but second hand clothes stores DO have a huge range of sizes. Personally, the TK Maxx in town is my haven. 

3: I didn‚Äôt realise that a company which sells ¬£15 dresses do expert tailoring?? As someone who also needs to buy out-of-the-ordinary clothes sizes, your excuse to use Shein for this reason is inexcusable. 

Sorry, but it felt necessary to post this. I‚Äôm sure people have their own difficult experiences of money and clothes buying, as do I (I receive the full Cambridge bursary), but personally I believe this should NEVER be an excuse to buy into companies that represent the worst of contemporary global manufacturing. 

Enjoy your May Ball x

It's both surprising and unsurprising to see that Cambridge SU has hit a new low, prompting students to organize an Extraordinary Student Members' Meeting! The secure petition, which takes just a few seconds to sign here: https://forms.office.com/e/vmnnJxkLHc, has already been backed by 110 students, nearing the threshold of 200 signatures to challenge the status quo. Show your support by signing the petition, which aims to make Cambridge student life more vibrant amidst the following concerning issues:

1. Half of the full-time elected sabbatical officers, all from marginalized identities, have resigned from the Cambridge SU. It is unclear whether their resignations were voluntary or coerced.
2. Remaining sabbatical officer(s) from marginalized identities is/are being prevented from attending and chairing meetings they are mandated to.
3. The SU has not held by-elections to fill vacant positions despite repeated requests from students, including those with disabilities.
4. A sabbatical officer, who is also a major union officer of the university, received formal warnings from Cambridge SU for raising concerns about the SU‚Äôs finances before the Council Committee for Supervision of Students Union (CCSSU).
5. A sabbatical trustee, who requested transaction report in past, has been suspended coercively. 
6. Financial transactions have been conducted in violation of the SU‚Äôs own finance policy, from an annual budget of over ¬£1 million.

Big questions remain: Where is the effective student representation, and why are the Cambridge SU and the university not keen to fill the vacant positions? More importantly, where is the money provided by the collegiate university to the Cambridge SU embezzled?

Huge fan of so much of the work of the students, staff and community on the Cambridge for Palestine encampment. The organisation has been seriously impressive, and the early wins, including Trinity ditching weapons investments, show that it's working. As in times gone by, Cambridge will not stay quiet as atrocities unfold.

I would love to see more effort to include as many of Cambridge's Jews as possible, which means avoiding identifying participants solely as anti-Zionist on leaflets, as polls show the majority of British Jews identify as Zionists (though different people use the term differently), including many who are anti-occupation and anti-war. It also means avoiding ambiguous phrases such as 'from the river to the sea' which - even if not the intent - can read to many Jews as if they're not welcome. Particularly importantly it means not labelling Senate House with the name of someone, Refaat, who described the Hamas attacks as ‚Äúlegitimate and moral‚Äù and joked (and I can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm typing this) about a baby being killed ‚Äúwith or without baking powder‚Äù - no matter how well-respected his poetry may be, nor how unjust his killing (like any) was.

Cambridge's Jews and Israelis, like its Muslims and Palestinians, are deeply traumatised by the horrific events since October 7th, on top of all the violence that came before, and the accompanying surge in antisemitism and Islamophobia, and desperately want an end to the violence. That means the university ending its complicity in destruction, as the encampment demands. To build the broad base we need to end Israel's brutal occupation of Gaza and the West Bank, and win a free Palestine alongside a free Israel, we need everyone on board, and that must include the majority of British Jews who are understandably fearful right now. I really hope the encampment will actively build trust and demonstrate it is a safe space for all who want to see a free Palestine, and that the University of Cambridge will come to the negotiating table and accept the demands.

Exam existentialism is really hitting hard... got me (a second year) wondering what do people recommend doing to make the most out of their last year at uni?  Is it too late to join new societies and make new friends in your third year, and is there realistically even enough time for that if you need to be prepping for final year exams?

Despite this only affecting Mathmos, please do have a read and understand our plight.

What proportion of final year students get good honours (2:1 or above)? 91% but in maths this figure is a low 70%.
What does that mean for the 30%? A struggle to prove their talent to future employers or gain admission to future masters programs.
Comparable 2:1 or above rates at Oxford Warwick Imperial: 85% 90% 90% for good honours.

Why is it so low at Cambridge? Are we doing easy stuff - that can‚Äôt be the case, in fact in terms of rigour or course is hardest in the UK and is renowned for that reason, in fact some courses surpass the difficult of topics at Masters Level at above mentioned universities.
Are students dumber here? No - around 25% of the cohort has participated in international olympiads on behalf of their country and STEP is by far the hardest entrance exam in the UK.

As someone who might get a 2:2 or below, I beg all MATHMOS and anyone who cares please like this as support so we can build a case and get word out there! It‚Äôs so difficult when I hear people say, ‚Äúyes I‚Äôll definitely get a 2:1, it‚Äôs a first that‚Äôs an issue‚Äù when for me I‚Äôm worried about making my graduate job requirement of 2:1. Yes I‚Äôm from Cambridge but this doesn‚Äôt mean standards don‚Äôt apply to me to.

SU please can you provide us with any tangible support that you can so that we can bring this case to the university and fight for this.

Thanks for reading.

RANKING CAMBRIDGE MAY BALLS BY THEME (bc mine was cancelled and I'm sad)

S tier:
1. Newnham/Myth & Magic: What says Newnham more than cottage core, and what says cottage core more than myth & magic. Perfect for a garden party
2. Medwards/No Place Like Dome: RIP, the pun was truly beautiful and you will be missed

A tier: 
3. Homerton/Cupid and Psyche: Love it, no notes (but will make me feel even more single)
4. Clare/Danse Macabre: Gothic, beautiful, love the skull/ballet shoe moment
5. Christs/Midsummer Night's Dream: Classic May Ball theme vibes, but with a bit of a twist. Social media looking beautiful
6. Jesus/Into the Surreal: something a bit different, hope they pull it off (I want surreal Jorse) 

B tier:
7. Sidney Sussex/Eventide: not sure what it means, but beautiful insta graphics (love that wisteria)
8. Robinson/Transcendence: Love the originality, not sure how they'll manage it with the decoration but excited to see
9. Kings/Falselore: like Newnham's theme but more pretentious and unsettling. Great social media presence though
10. Trinity Hall/The Thirteenth Hour: Like Clare's theme but more pretentious
Emma/Dreamscape: bold promises, slightly confusing, will they deliver?
 
C tier
11. Pembroke/Time Warp: Like the clock graphic on the website but it makes me feel a bit sick
Churchill/YEAR 3000: Very Churchill in aesthetics but feels quite dystopian

D tier:
12. Caius/Renascentia: Loses points for the pretentious Latin name, but the colour scheme looks nice

F tier:
Dishonourable mentions: Peterhouse, Trinity and Johns: all too fancy to have a theme

Cambridge colleges as politicians 
1. Christ‚Äôs = David Cameron, sensible but unlikeable also coalition (you and Cauis) 
2. Churchill = Reagan, i don‚Äôt like ur vibe 
3. Clare = Gordon Brown, you‚Äôre cute and friendly but can get freaky (we‚Äôve all seen Clare compliments)
4. Clare Hall = Peter Mandelson, you‚Äôre the Btec and slightly annoying sidekick of Clare and wish you had the rep (money) of Tony Blair (johns)
5. Corpus Christi = George Santos, you walk a thin line between cunty (fancy clock) and evil 
6. Downing = King Charles, You are technically big and powerful but actually serve nothing
7. Emma = Clement Attlee,  you‚Äôre nice but lack a strong distinct personality
8. Fitz = Jeremy Corbyn, you‚Äôre modern and it works but can be controversial 
9. Girton = Biden, the more I get to know you the less I like you 
10. Caius = Donald Trump, we know who you are but the reputation is scary 
11. Homerton = Joseph Stalin, far away and i don‚Äôt like you 
12. Jesus = Boris Johnson, you get everyone with your charm (pretty buildings) but fuck everyone else over (stop winning all the sports)
13. King‚Äôs = Lenin, good vibes and ideas but sometimes i don‚Äôt know what going on with you 
14. Lucy Cavendish = Che Gavara, socialist icon and are fighting to the death (housing crisis)
15. Magdalene = Alastair Campbell,  you‚Äôre just a lad who wants a podcast 
16. Murray Edwards = Michelle Obama, girl boss slay, you have good fits and do good work keep it up
17. Newnham = Hilary Clinton, a powerful woman who just did not quite make it
18. Pembroke = Obama, sometimes you eat sometimes you don‚Äôt 
19. Peterhouse = Liz Truss, you‚Äôre small and powerful (oldest college) but gonna be irrelevant soon 
20. Queens = Kamala Harris, you have potential but I have yet to see it 
21. Robinson = Kier Starmer, you pretend to be working class but we see right through it 
22. Selwyn College =  Rishi, nobody knows why you‚Äôre here (next to sidge) 
23. Sidney Sussex = Thatcher, you lure people in with the promises (cheap drinks), but have a dark soul 
24. Catz = Teresa may, you put in a shift but decided just to run through a field of wheat 
25. Johns = Tony Blair, everyone knows who you are, some would say you have too much power
26. Trinity = Winston Churchill, people remember you fondly but forget about your questionable aspects 
27. Tit Hall = G.W. Bush, with that location being so irrelevant is a war crime

If your college wasn‚Äôt mentioned it's because you lost the election sorry babe x

I just find it incredibly unfair how some finalists have closed book exams, whilst others only have open book ones. I‚Äôm a bio natsci feeling so unbelievably burnt out trying to memorise 63738269 pieces of experimental evidence and then citations for papers written a good 40 years ago- why am I wasting so much time on this, rather than spending the time developing strong scientific arguments and exploring the topics in more depth? I understand the majority of the course content, but I‚Äôm worried that I‚Äôm going to be marked down as I‚Äôm really struggling to memorise all of this extra stuff. I‚Äôm so incredibly jealous of my friends doing subjects such as law and HSPS who don‚Äôt have to spend days and days memorising such pointless pieces of information (that is not to say I don‚Äôt think their exams should be open book- I do, and I think it should be standardised across subjects). When will the university realise that times have changed and (*shock horror*) scientists do actually use google too!

CN: anorexia (positive!) 
. 
. 
. 
. 
. 
. 
. 
. 
. 
. 
To anyone thinking about starting a super restrictive (or tbh any restrictive diet) for a ‚Äòsummer body‚Äô, or going back to your old ED because you‚Äôre stressed and tired and feel like everything is falling apart and it gives you a semblance of control, this is your sign, your permission to not‚Ä¶

I hate anorexia so much - of all the things I‚Äôve dealt with in my life (oxbridge finals, breakups, friendship acrimony, family drama) I‚Äôd honestly say it‚Äôs the worst by quite a long shot; but you only realise how bad it it when you‚Äôre in the depths of it, and climbing out again is hell. Even with Herculean levels of motivation to escape anorexia‚Äôs tentacles it is hell. 
At first it‚Äôs so nice; the euphoria of the initial phases of starvation and the reward of watching bits of your body you‚Äôve hated for years just melt away overnight. It‚Äôs even more true if you‚Äôre using it to cope with everything else going wrong; successfully going for day(s) without eating and the associated weight loss offering the escape of feeling, for the first time in months, that you‚Äôve actually managed to achieve something.

But it‚Äôs short lived, and the longer you go on the more unhappy you become; your starved body becomes increasingly numb to anything and everything, unable to think of anything other than food, and hating itself for thinking incessantly about the thing you‚Äôve told yourself and told yourself you don‚Äôt need. Your life shrinks to a small circle of when you can eat next, and how much; your day becoming consumed by trying to work out if you‚Äôre close enough to collapse to justify a sandwich. You loose the ability to take joy in anything- conversation becomes exhausting, and even watching Netflix or reading a book becomes joyless as youre constantly beset by endless thoughts of food. It‚Äôs inescapable. Or if you‚Äôre not beset by thoughts of food, you‚Äôre being tortured by the guilt of the thought of the food you‚Äôve eaten, or just generally struggling to focus because of the brain fog; except you don‚Äôt realise it‚Äôs brain fog because of starvation because you think you‚Äôre eating too much and that the reason you can‚Äôt think or focus or function, or honestly even see, is because you‚Äôre stupid and an imposter and so you despise yourself even more and so starve yourself even more. 

The brain fog creeps up slowly - at first starvation offers mental clarity, and so you think your brain functions better without food. It‚Äôs a lie- over time, slowly, as your body becomes increasingly used to being starved and so adapts to compensate, it will restrict your ability to think clearly. But walking round Cambridge, holding a conversation, trying to think, trying to see; everything feels like such a challenge, such an effort, such a task. The world shrinks and feels inexplicably dark and scary.
For months, the world has existed apart from me; it is as being behind a cloudy screen, where you can see everything going on, but you‚Äôre unable to feel as if you‚Äôre there. I feel like every social conversation I‚Äôve had for months has been in some way a lie, my participation involving a calculation of the bare minimum of effort to appear to engage, while feeling like it‚Äôs happening from behind a screen, or in a different realm. If you‚Äôve never experienced it, it‚Äôs difficult to imagine, but let me assure you, dearest, gentle reader, it is misery.
Starvation is misery. The idea that you‚Äôll be happy when you reach x size, when you go y amount of time without eating or manage to only eat z amount of calories in a day is a delusion. It is impossible to feel happiness when you are starved. The misery is not from having to miss out on a tasty treat; it is a simple biological response to an insufficient m number of calories.
It is impossible to derive any joy out of anything in life when you are starved. No matter how big the win, how good the event, if you are in a state of deprivation, you will feel nothing. And there‚Äôs a decent chance that due to your general inability to function as a consequence of said deprivation, you‚Äôll loose friends and partners and opportunities in the process, and so actually everything will become an order of magnitude worse. 
  
The irony of all of this is that it is, obviously, remedied by food. The problem is that once you‚Äôve reached the depths of starvation, you‚Äôve lost the ability to know how much food a human needs, and every single bite is acute mental torture. This isn‚Äôt your own weakness; various studies (the minesota starvation experiment is particularly interesting here) suggest that when the body becomes starved it develops a paradoxical aversion to food; perhaps because it‚Äôs learned it‚Äôs a scarce resource that needs to be rationed. But it is hell. You exist in one of two states; consumed by thoughts of food or plans for when you can next eat, or consumed by overwhelming and soul crushing guilt for the food you‚Äôve eaten. The amount of time I‚Äôve spend seeking solace in the department bathrooms this year, either to have somewhere to sit in an endeavour to not fall over before the allocated time I could eat my sandwich, or to have a panic attack after eating said sandwich because of the guilt, is, honestly, tragic. Trying to pipette with a mind either clouded by the fog of starvation or (still clouded by the fog of starvation) but simultaneously screaming at you for having eaten a sandwich is just miserable.
That is the reality of anorexia.

I am getting better, and I will be fine. The world slowly feels like it‚Äôs coming back into colour and I never, ever want to go back to the darkness of the past few months. This has been the worst year of my life because of this and I would give a lot to be able to go back in time a year, and show the girl I was what embarking on her ‚Äòshort term‚Äô restrictive diet would do, I would. So this is a message to anyone who was in the position I was last year. You will not be the exception and this can and will destroy your life, far far more than buying one dress size up will,  so just don‚Äôt do it. 

Making healthier, natural/less processed/whole food based choices out of love and respect for your body is one thing, (if ED recovery has taught me anything it‚Äôs that my body does actually appreciate being fed fruit and vegetables more than Pringles haha) but restrictive eating with the goal to eat as little as possible / general starvation will only ever end one way, and you won‚Äôt know that it‚Äôs led to that until it‚Äôs too late.

Colleges as Bridgerton characters 

(Because the last one didn‚Äôt give any explanations and I too want to procrastinate from exams)

Christ‚Äôs - Lord Debley (just wants to study the natural word; he would be cut out for Christ‚Äôs rigorous academic standards)
Churchill - Gregory (honestly don‚Äôt have an opinion on Churchill; Gregory will eventually emerge as he gets older and has his own storylines)
Clare - Penelope Featherington (the colour yellow, and the newly reopened sunken garden would be a lovely place for her to sit and read)
Clare hall - Lady Whistledown‚Äôs voice (Julie Andrews‚Äô voice is like butter and compliments Pen as LW)
Corpus - Daphne (the it girl of the ton; tourists crowd around corpus clock. Porters are fiercely protective of the college like Antony is of Daphne at the beginning)
Downing - Colin Bridgerton (both are very easy on the eye, near to the language centre and Colin probably picked up some languages during his travels)
Emma - Madame Delacroix (she works with clothes; Emma has free laundry)
Fitz - Marina Thompson (gave birth to a bastard; bastards were traditionally given names like Fitzwilliam, Fitzroy, etc)
Girton - Francesca (beautiful, loves her peace and quiet though and Girton is far enough out of the city centre to grant her that)
Caius - Portia Featherington (high aspirations, not the friendliest reputation though)
Homerton - the duke (gorgeous, where is he though after season 1 üò≠; Homerton is very pretty but very far)
Hughes - Lord Mondrich (like a mature student at Hughes, he didn‚Äôt become a lord until later)
Jesus - Kate Sharma (sporty, loves horse riding)
King‚Äôs - King George (obvious)
Lucy cav - Jack Featherington (scam artist; Lucy cav‚Äôs ridiculous accommodation prices  are a scam üíî)
Magdalene 1 - Antony Bridgerton (was a rake and couldn‚Äôt just let his sister Daphne shine but eventually came around; Magdalene didn‚Äôt allow women until 1988)
Medwards - Siena Rosso (working woman in a man‚Äôs world)
Newnham - Eloise (getting queer energy from her, please just make Cressida and Eloise a thing, I beg of you)
Pembroke - Hyacinth Bridgerton (similar to Churchill, see above)
Peterhouse - Lord Danbury (just really old. I‚Äôm including characters from Queen Charlotte in this, ok?)
Queens‚Äô - Queen Charlotte (again, obvious)
Robinson - Cressida Cowper (no one‚Äôs first choice college or wife but fairly central to everything nonetheless)
Selwyn - Benedict (he‚Äôs super artistic and would 100% be a sidge girlie)
Sidney - Philippa Finch, n√©e Featherington (honestly a sweetheart and I don‚Äôt have anything bad to say about either Sidney or Philippa)
Catz - Violet Bridgerton (super mum and a saint, deserves to be paired with the college named after a female saint)
Johns - First Duke of Hasting‚Äôs (rich, no redeeming qualities beyond that really)
Trinity - Lady Danbury (iconic, rich, powerful, the puppet master of the ton, very close to the Queen; trinity is the second biggest landowner in the UK after the royal family)
Wolfson - Mr Finch (he‚Äôs giving golden retriever and I‚Äôm here for it)

CN: panic attacks, s*xual harrassment etc
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
Long story short, my former next door neighbour was an absolute creep, etc etc, I started feeling unsafe around college, and especially on my corridor/in my room, etc etc, the standard Cambridge situation of college does nothing while student suffers, etc etc, student basically camps out at department / friends rooms, etc etc. Eventually I got moved to a different building, and surprise surprise, panic attacks stopped, everything improved, and I started to feel less like I was at risk of being raped every time I was in college (like, the guy had a reputation + had issues). 

Obviously no consequences for him!! Me: has panic attacks, avoids all college spaces for fear of him, eventually has the most awkward conversation ever with college as nobody took any of the other reports seriously. He's still getting on with life as per usual, and college tried to justify his behaviour (like, no???). It's not my fault for not mentioning it earlier until I had a strong case that would've been police-worthy and found people who'd back me up?? And I know other people reported him too (I think)?? And I don't really want to think about the possible impacts on his life or the justifications for his actions after everything that happened to me?? Like, if telling the police would get him jail time (it was a lot of people), it seems *slightly* unfair that college did f*ck all, but ah well, such is life. 

If anyone feels like going all - but # not all men - the guy harrassed guys to. Like, yep. 

Anyway, the panic attacks resumed at the start of this term, I feel like I can't breathe properly and have felt like that for weeks, and have an exam basically tomorrow! The joys! F*ck that guy and college for basically enabling him.

Just a thought.

hello! i relate to you, almost exactly the same situ. it is so hard to navigate a bad-ish home life and uni can be the first time you‚Äôre exposed to other lifestyles and realise what was was lacking in your own. take your time and be patient. i‚Äôm a postgrad now and i still struggle, but it‚Äôs much better than in my first and second years. keep putting one foot in front of the other, prioritise meeting your physical needs and keeping yourself comfortable. 

your brain is running a marathon right now, and it‚Äôs perfectly understandable other things might slip. i know it‚Äôs hard with how much people can be in your business at college but try to validate your own ‚Äòatypical‚Äô eating/sleeping/resting habits because trying to be ‚Äònormal‚Äô only puts you further in the hole. you have to find your own purpose for doing self-care, for doing hobbies. this is so important for those of us whose families didn‚Äôt teach us that we deserve fulfilment in every sense. 

if your space has too many connotations, maybe also work on finding external spaces you can access that same feeling of comfort. doing this solo helped me to find ‚Äòmy‚Äô spaces, even if they were pretty public - reading in the botanical gardens in summer is a fave. another cliche bit of advice is setting phone reminders with messages of love & hope. sometimes i roll my eyes at mine, but sometimes they hit just when i need them and i‚Äôm reminded how hard i work for myself everyday, despite never being shown i should.

as you mentioned you haven‚Äôt told friends, i think it‚Äôs worth having a think about what you can tell people that makes you comfortable & lets them into your life a little bit. i worked with my therapist on this and found concealing my oddities was contributing to general feelings of shame common in abused/neglected people. you don‚Äôt have to tell them every detail of your childhood, but it‚Äôs not embarrassing to say some variation on ‚Äòi struggle with x‚Äô, ‚Äòi struggle with x due to some past issues‚Äô etc. your friends want to love & help you, & so many people have issues with e.g. eating for myriad reasons. if it‚Äôs come up in a conversation and you haven‚Äôt known what to say, maybe reflect for next time and have a strategy for how much info you‚Äôre happy to give. sharing authentic love with friends really reinforced how i deserve to be treated & helped me find my voice. plus, it supports you practically in limiting time with family. 

lastly, bit of a cliche, but you are stronger than you know, and struggling doesn‚Äôt always look like an aestheticised cry in the shower. whatever your struggle looks like, it‚Äôs valid and it‚Äôs not your fault. sometimes it‚Äôs struggling to keep your space clean, take medication, cook complex meals, or struggling to see the purpose in getting out of bed if you lived in a household where bed was the best alternative. 

i still spend a lot of time in bed. but i also have more fulfilling things going on in my life and a better idea of how i want to be treated! i won‚Äôt lie to you, this healing process will be long, but it‚Äôll unleash happiness you couldn‚Äôt even imagine was possible. just think, there‚Äôs a whole universe of love that was denied to us, to discover. you are going to be okay. you are healing.

Really specific post I know, but I'm coming to terms with the fact that I was physically and emotionally neglected during my childhood. I never talk about this to anyone apart from therapists because I'm still have a good relationship with my parents and don't want to bring shame on them, but it can feel really lonely and isolating sometimes. This is specific to me, but friends have commented that I have strange eating patterns and spend a lot of time in bed when I'm stressed, and I know it all leads back to how I coped as a child but I've no way of formulating that because it's so embarrassing. The only way I can express it is this bit cloud that lingers over me, affects how I act (eg it's really hard for me to ask for help because I've always sorted myself out) I guess what I'm trying to find is a) maybe some solidarity on how hard it is, or failing that b) maybe understanding that while my situation might not be typical, that means it's okay for me to struggle sometimes compared to others. And maybe if you relate, know that I see you and understand how hard it is, but you are so brave to keep going, and you're not alone.

Us mathmos have complete closed book exams. On the one hand, I kind of get the purpose of memorizing things in maths. If, for example, I never learned the quadratic formula at GCSE off by heart, or something like that, it'd slow my work down doing example sheets so much. But on the other hand, every time I ask my DoS/a supervisor/a lecturer about a thing, they so often have looked up formulas and stuff, even the "basic" ones. It's kinda annoying lol cos there's so much stuff we have to commit to memory that literally everyone just looks up all the time

Exams are coming up, and I may have a problem. My boyfriend just broke into freestyle rap during sex. He was running his hands over me, and I asked him what he was doing, as he seemed quite uncaring of where his hands were (distributing attention equally). After a little thought, he came out with ‚ÄúMaybe I should be, maybe I should be biased - towards your clitoral hood, raised just like it‚Äôs on a dais‚Äù. There was a pillow.

Is this normal for Cambridge relationships?
