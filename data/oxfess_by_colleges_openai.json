The harsh truth is that many changes that this country needs often requires more than a 5 year term to properly deliver. (Especially things like building houses where we have to balance it with issues like food sovereignty, climate change, nimbyism and immigration). If a politician sincerely express the will to enact long-term changes and wants to tackle the political short-termism that has plagued this country for so long, then we as people need to give them a chance to do that.

It\u2019s cheap but unfortunately also tastes it, v limey and will 100% give u heartburn in atik later. Below average but that 2 for 7.50 deal can\u2019t be ignored. Bonus points if u get lucky enough to get a salted rim\ud83d\ude0d 5.9/10 The Varsity Club (club night) - I\u2019ve got to admit, my memories of this are vague and unreliable however this tasted completely different to the other margaritas I have drank here. Extremely limey, successfully hiding the tequila flavour, but quite literally giving me cuts around the mouth and acid burnt lips. Heartburn went crazy after 2 of these (don\u2019t ask why I had another one) 6/10 Three goats heads - heavy and I mean HEAVY on the tequila. You definitely get what u pay for in spirit but the alleged peach flavour is nowhere to be found. So much ice that I\u2019m not actually sure this contains anything but thoughts of lime juice, however, won\u2019t give u heartburn which is a major plus. Spenny so gonna dock some points for that 6.3/10 The Varsity Club (rooftop bar) - as strong as its goats head counterpart, but better balanced, to result in a much more pleasant overall drinking experience. V smooth and goes down easy (this depends on you liking tequila, the person I was with went through the five stages of grief upon trying this cocktail) with no heartburn to worry about later. Tastes fresh and with the breeze blowing on ur face, u could almost imagine being in Mexico. Very reasonably priced for a bar with table service 9.7/10 M&S - it\u2019s out of a can but SO much better than the spoons monstrosity. Perfect balance of sweet tequila and sour lime. Bonus points for being strong without tasting strong, and cheap without tasting cheap. Can also be taken on the go (another win against its spoons counterpart). No notes 10/10 To review: (please give me ideas\ud83e\udef6) Turf tavern Hanks The crown"

In the battle of the country\u2019s top centres of erudition, Oxford by far has the superior traditions. In matters of ranking, the tabs fall down, National surveys still reflect greater Oxonian renown. Though as of late, Cantabus has claimed the boat race, We\u2019ll be back and tab dominance displaced. In naming terms you tabs fall short, Whereas our founders crafted names that truly exhort. Testament to our greater rizz, we are a cathedral city! You\u2019ve only assorted chapels, what a pity?! A 13th-century foundation date is hardly a slay, Bitch by then we were already a mainstay. Your haphazard city centre, Is truly a nightmare for all to enter. You\u2019re the historic abode of our runaway academics, And classing dinner jackets as sub-fusc is an epidemic. In the battle of Oxbridge, the og comes out on top, For real, Cambridge uni just flops. Neither plenty of chapels nor good rowing, Will ever stop you tab bastards from completely blowing."

I hate how inadequate I was made to feel because of the module's notorious difficulty, the relentless imposter syndrome it set off, and my tutor's disdain for me lol. Since then, I've progressed immensely by studying topics my 1st-year self never could've imagined I could understand. I should feel proud but it never feels enough- the sadness is lingering and idk how to make peace with it before exams and graduation :(\n\n(Obvs I'm not the first or last person to have had bad tutorials, maybe I need to accept the humility, and see it as an invitation to heal my self-esteem etc etc, but all easier said than done!)"

(Turns coffee maker on). \n\n6AM: Time for some irony and say my daily pledge of allegiance to the flag of the United States of America... but God save the king. \n\n7AM: Today is gonna be... 6 DEGREES???? Oh sorry I forgot us Americans are the only ones that used Fahrenheit - yes don't make fun of me. I'm team Celsius but still learning... Ok time for the mental maths... minus 32, times 5 divided by 9...., 42.8 degrees Fahrenheit today.\n\n8AM: Ingesting some Weetabix with some vitamin D pills cos there is like no sunlight ever in this part of the world. \n\n9AM: Off to my English and Creative Writing lectures and learning about Old Middle English. Basically the American accent is closer to what Shakespeare spoke and we are the ones that get called out for apparently not speaking the \"correct\" version of English \ud83d\ude44... Silly Brits. \n\n11AM: Random thought while studying. Why are your doughnuts in Tesco so small? It's barely enough to keep a mouse going and why is it not shaped like a torus? \n\n1PM: OMG I've drunken a whole pint of coffee without realising... Whoops? Struggling to stay stable on the sidewalk with all that sugar and caffeine rush...\n\n4PM: Off to the library and reading the Bible. If you can recommend me some King James Bible classes in Oxford do let me know :)\n\n6PM: Ordering some dominoes and it's...... \u00a320!??? What are your pizzas made of? Gold!? Anyways, it does taste slightly better than what we get on the other side of the pond. But then I'm paying more than twice the price I would pay in America so one would hope its better in some way....\n\n7PM: Getting bullied by my flatmates because I said I needed to buy a new fannypack instead of \"bumbag\".\n\n9PM: Calling my parents back in Tennessee. \n\n10PM: Prayers before bed and sleep while not knowing that I forgot to buy some coffee today ...

When you are just copying what the lecturer writes, your attention is split into notetaking and listening to the lecturer. It is better to just listen to the lecturer with 100% of your conversation and take small notes during the lecture, and then writing your lectures up AFTER it.  If you have lecture notes available, then actively review what you are going to learn before you enter the lecture hall.\n\n2) Stop rereading your notes. The reason many people do this is because it is the easiest form of revision but it is also the most inefficient.  It gives you the illusion of \"effort\" when you are using your favourite colouring pencils and drawing really asthetically pleasing revision notes but I'm reality, all you are doing is just wasting time and not actually improving your long-term memory skills. \nDoing practice questions, testing yourself regularly through available practice questions and revisiting the material periodically throughout the course makes revision less burdensome during the exam season and tests your ability much better. This makes revision more uncomfortable, burdensome and harder but being able to endure this is what makes the difference between a student who gets a First and a student who gets a 2:1 or 2:2."

Engage in the art of subtlety, weaving webs of intellect that ensnare the minds of professors and peers alike, for the Bene Gesserit know the power of influence.\n\n3. Master the ancient languages, deciphering the cryptic runes of academia with the precision of a Fremen knife.\n\n4. Embrace the rhythm of debate, where words are swords and arguments are shields, honing your skills in the arena of discourse.\n\n5. Forge alliances with the wise and the cunning, for in the halls of power, strength lies in unity, and alliances are the spice that sustains the empire.\n\n6. Delve into the depths of history, learning from the mistakes of the past as the Guild Navigators chart the course of the future.\n\n7. Let curiosity be your guide, exploring the uncharted territories of knowledge like a desert wanderer seeking the hidden springs of Sietch Tabr.\n\n8. Master the art of time management, for like sand slipping through an hourglass, the sands of academia wait for no one.\n\n9. Cultivate resilience in the face of adversity, for the journey to enlightenment is fraught with challenges, and only the strong will endure.\n\n10. And finally, remember the words of the Litany Against Fear, for in the crucible of Oxford, where dreams are forged and destinies entwined, fear is the mind-killer that must be faced with steely resolve.\n\nThus spoke the prophecy, whispered on the winds of Arrakis, echoing through the corridors of time to guide the seeker on their quest for academic glory at Oxford."

I\u2019ve not really touched my sport since, and not sure if I ever want to again. I still love it, but over the decade I\u2019ve spent playing it, it feels like I\u2019ve been continuously screwed over. The worst thing is, no one on the team has my back on this.

Offer reduced mortgages for people who have more than 1 child.\n\n-Increase income tax if the person earns over \u00a350k and is still single by 45.\n\n-Reduce tax on income gained from overtime in tertiary sectors.\n\n-Integrate industry work experience with secondary education for people who want it. Lower the age for legal employment to 15 and give options for young people to opt-out from GCSEs in exchange for part-time vocational training in key STEM industries. Introduce new subjects like Video Editting, 3D modelling, and Computer Programming.\n\n-Employ computer scientists with \u00a3100k salaries to update public sector softwares including the NHS.

Psychiatrists and doctors have been studying these for years, some being their careers and you are effectively nullifying their years expertise just because you \"feel\" like you definitely have it.

People should expect better instead from their doctors and the government rather than googling the DSM V. I don't even know how people could say it with a straight face- imagine walking around with self-diagnosed schizophrenia or self-diagnosed mania. By the logic of self-diagnosis, if you can self-diagnose that opens you up to anyone, including me 'un-diagnosing' you because you don't seem consistent with my own personal (and non professional) research. You could reasonably claim anyone as faking.\n\nThe biggest issue with it is honestly the 'tiktokification' of 'neurodivergence'/'neurospicy'/'Audhd'. There's so many videos over-pathologising normal behaviour, even if it can be difficult to deal with, like uncomfortable social settings or just wanting a routine comfort meal. There's infantilising autism by associating it with plushies, 'aesthetic' stim toys, and 'quirky' special interests. Autism has become a bit of meaningless term and I feel for people who now find it harder to access support."

High speed rail services are excellent unlike the UK where we can't even build 100 miles in 20 years let alone 10,000 km in 10 years. Trains run on time. Healthcare here is much better managed than UK's horrible excuse of a healthcare system (the NHS) and is affordable. I find the people are much better behaved and more disciplined than British people. \nRetirement age is 55 years (for me as a woman) so people can actually enjoy their retirement. \n\nI am working towards obtaining my Chinese Citizenship and hope to become part of the Communist Youth League so that I can be work with my comrades to contribute to continue building the greatest Socialist Powerhouse.  I am seeing more and more Westerners coming over here as through the help of social media, people are seeing that there is a viable alternative to the ruthless, oppressive capitalist/democratic system that privileges the rich few over the proletariat workers. People are starting to realise that China isn't this evil boogeyman that the State Department/MI6 propaganda press outlets like you to think it is."
