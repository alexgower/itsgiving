      "text": "I wanted to write this as the ongoing controversy concerning the LMH Foundation Year has left a very bitter taste in my mouth and I believe it\u2019s important that people see this issue from another perspective. I\u2019ll premise this by saying that the LMH FY is a complicated and unique programme in which there are few guarantees. It appears this fact has been lost in the reductive discourse posted on social media and in student publications, and it seems particularly clear that little effort has been spent contacting previous LMH FY students to gain this rather important information. Every year, LMH interviews a number of prospective students. As expected, this number is far greater than the places offered. This is similar to the standard Oxford interview process. However, where they differ is that \u2013 whilst for the standard undergraduate courses there are a guaranteed number of offers given per course per year \u2013 this guarantee does not exist for the FY. The reasons behind this are multifactorial: funding must be available, tutors must be on board with taking on FY students, appropriate students must be found, and \u2013 most importantly \u2013 the are more potential subjects that are interviewed for than there are available places. These factors change year to year. Hence, you may be the first person ever to be accepted for English; you also may be the last. Furthermore, it is possible for individuals to be interviewed for a given subject and no one subsequently receive an offer for that subject. My point here is that the way this issue has been presented is that \u201cLMH have removed their Law Foundation Year\u201d. There is no Law FY. There is only the FY, on which an offer for Law may or may not be given, depending on the year. Not offering this particular student does not equate to one less student being offered a place for the FY. Another, equally as worthy, student will fill that place, be it for a different subject. Another issue I take with this controversy is the manner in which it has been presented: a noble and virtuous crusade against LMH in the face of perceived anti-access actions. Let\u2019s not forget that LMH is far and above every other college for even offering a FY in the first place and that the creation of the university-wide Astrophoria FY can be in large part be attributed to the pro-access steps taken by LMH. This situation is incredibly unfortunate and highly upsetting to the individual involved. I do not mean to minimise that by writing this post. Nonetheless, attacking and vilifying the entire institution seems excessive and the very public manner in which it has occurred seems borderline performative. It must also be considered that this individual will not have been the only person rejected from the FY, many of whom will be experiencing similar disappointment. It is unfortunate that the reasoning behind this decision was logistical as opposed to merit-based, but it certainly will not be the only decision that was made this way. The LMH FY is logistically difficult and stands loftily atop a temporary scaffold built around the undergraduate teaching system. Hopefully, the establishment of the Astrophoria FY will create more consistency. LMH will obviously be looking at this pragmatically; it is foolish to believe otherwise. Law tutors, now stretched thin, will not be able to work over their contracted hours and it is not unreasonable that they would prioritise undergraduates. It is not as simple as \u201cfinding other tutors\u201d: LMH is the only college that offer this form of teaching and simply passing FY students off to PhD students undermines the concept that you receive an education of similar quality and rigour to undergraduates. In the aftermath of the last two years, colleges are seeing soaring costs across the board; I\u2019m sure many of you will experience significant rent hikes next year. It is simply na\u00efve to expect LMH to go above and beyond to facilitate a single student studying a particular course at significant extra cost when this place can be offered to a student studying a different subject. Again, this situation is desperately unfortunate for the individual it affects but it does not merit the outrage it has created."

Doesn\u2019t seem very inclusive that now we have a significant amount of Muslim students they\u2019re being excluded from such an event. Making a prayer room is not making it inclusive, the logistics team had to settle and try and support the Muslim students who did want to come. Would also like to note that Ramadan would literally end a few days after the current date, so I await a valid and published reason why."

I THINK he also likes to spend time with me but he doesn\u2019t really seem to be particularly interested in me because he often forgets things I\u2019ve said. So perhaps it wouldn\u2019t be worth it to tell him how I feel? I\u2019ve also never confessed my feelings to anyone before and never been in a relationship so this is all very nerve-wracking...

I am pleased to report that our recent theft of the beaver has thrown them into a frenzy, and they are surely scrambling to come up with a response. However, we cannot rest on our laurels. We have heard rumors that St Anne's are planning to steal my beloved brother, Professor Biscuit, and myself. As an admiral, I have faced many foes on the high seas, but none quite as ridiculous as this. I will not stand for this affront to our honor and dignity as cats and members of the St Hugh's community. We cats are not pawns to be used in their silly little game. I must address the issue of the beaver. Yes, we may have taken it from St Anne's, but let's face it, they were asking for it. That beaver was clearly in need of a new home, and we simply provided it with one. It's not our fault that St Anne's is so attached to their beaver, but they should have known better than to leave it unguarded. So, my fellow felines, let us not forget why we are fighting. We are fighting for our pride, our honor, and our right to sleep for 18 hours a day without disturbance. We will not let St Anne's take what is rightfully ours, and we will not back down from this war. Let us show them that we will not be cowered by their silly pranks and attempts at stealing our most prized possessions. We will rise victorious from this feud."

Whilst these individuals are entitled to have their own opinion on abortion and choose not to get one themselves, they are not entitled to take that choice away from women. If the basis of this society is to actively support and campaign for abortion to be banned, then why should this society be given a platform to promote rhetoric of denying women bodily autonomy. I am all for debate and encouraging discussion around polemical topics; however, I think people need to realise that OSFL aren\u2019t seeking to encourage debate but are actively participating in misogynistic movements and campaigns which are attempting to reverse abortion laws. It\u2019s harmful and for this to be promoted under the University\u2019s own name is questionable, which is probably why lots of students are upset given the privilege we have to live in a country where there is a choice\u2026 TLDR: Campaign against women\u2019s human rights and then promoting and enforcing the rhetoric on students under the guise of \u2018intellectual\u2019 debate shouldn\u2019t be platformed in this setting."

And they chose to name it Hertford College just cuz half a century ago a flimsy College with that name existed around there."

Onto that, Magdalen MCR didn't make a fuss. 12 people voted to change their common room's decoration, and suddenly journalists decided that was the most important thing happening at the moment. The media made a fuss for them. I'm sure Magdalen MCR would've loved to change their decoration in peace and not have cameras and criticism thrown at them for such a minor decision. Yes Oxford \"seems to be a Broadway show, not an academic institution\", yes it's a drama mess, but that's not the MCR's fault. All they did was change decoration. The people you want to aim at are the people who decided that was a very controversial move."

(I don't have flats or any nice shoes that aren't heels) Is this ball outside? If so, how do I not freeze? Do girls bring nice coats/jackets/extra layers or is a standard fluffy jacket ok? How long does this last? How long do ppl tend to stay? In fact, when does this start? Are most ppl on time? Can I leave and come back? What\u2019s at this ball? (Any Ferris wheel/ interesting stuff??) How casual can I go? Can I wear my favourite high street summer dress? any general tips?? Thanks sm!!!! Yours, a clueless ball attendee xoxo"

I've made a lot of great friends at Teddy; I've got a lot of good memories there; and sometimes it's really fun to be a student there... BUT the wider culture is so exclusionary. And it's not a hate crime to say that... In HT22 alone, there was literally a case of racist harrassment at hustings and a serious sexual assault case. The guys involved have been protected by their group of mates for a long time beforehand, when everyone knows the racist has been making racist statements since Freshers and the predator has been predatory since Freshers. This group is also a pretty dominant part of the social elements and culture of the hall. They even created weird socials like the AJCR and 'The Syndicate' - which are as embarrassingly lame as they sound, but for a lot of us, it's just an example of another thing we aren't invited to. People are legit so uncomfy with the vibe they're having to anonymously complain on Oxfess. Fun is not \"just fun\" at teddy. One oxfess wrote about having to eat lunch in the toilets because of how uncomfy the energy in the JCR is. What's \"trendy\" about that? POC feeling uncomfortable and upset with racists being socially accepted at teddy isn't \"hate\" and I'm not sure why it shocks people. The comment on drinking culture specifically is so relatable because the non-drinking events may be great, but it still is so alienating not drinking at teddy. This isn't on the Entz reps who are all amazing - it's about the culture created. This isn't a welfare issue. It isn't a personal attack on most students ( just to clarify for those of you who seem to lack any other identity than being a Teddy student and can't cope with any negative feeling about the place). Stop spamming Oxfess with all this defensive and dismissive teddy nationalism... If you're lucky enough to love the place, think a bit deeper about the experiences being shared here... Maybe you love the hall because you haven't experienced any form of harrassment. Maybe you're okay being friends with racists. Maybe you're just lucky enough to have missed the vibes being given out. Either way, a better response for the hall lovers in the crowd might be to start listening to the upset expressed and thinking about how to fix up."

And is there any possibility of me getting to move into one of the nicer buildings at a different college later on or straight up just switching colleges? I don't mean to sound ungrateful but I cant help feeling a bit disappointed. I know everyone supposedly grows to like their college after a few weeks but when I visited Catz it felt like someone dug up a bit of some random other uni and shoved it in Oxford. It's not bad, but I didn't apply for this I applied for the real Oxford experience."

      "text": "Oxhate to priority ballots at Catz. With so many people getting access to priority for non-substantial reasons, you're creating a two tiered system which f*cks those who don't have a friend who can claim based on their disability. One class of people gets access to a first choice of the nicest accommodation, whilst the other class has to pick at scraps for sh*tty accommodation, with tiny rooms, and sometimes not even a sink.\n\nAccess to an en-suite shouldn't be reserved to the groups which can claim. It's completely unfair to create a system which rewards those who could easily cope without (you did in first year, right?), by providing such a privilege to 1+3 friends. The fact that me and my friends are completely out of the race  for nice rooms because none of us are disabled is absolutely unequitable - at least allow us to compete here please.\n\nIn cases of genuine need, I understand the essential nature of the extra facilities. The issue arises from the fact there is no longer a distinction between genuine need, and the \"well I can claim, so I will, even though I don't exactly need it, and I'll pick 3 friends to come with me\". I don't blame them for doing it, the system is flawed.\n\nPriority should be for the priority holder only (or even with a +1). Allowing groups of up to 4 is taking away any fairness for everyone else. I'm certain that if you limited it to 2 people per group, you'd ensure only those who genuinely need it get it, whilst allowing for a fair competition for everyone else to secure decent rooms next year."

I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if we ended up staying in this hotel for the entire term. While college has done a good job at sorting out a back up plan, hotel rooms are not designed to be lived in for a month. Storage, laundry, socialising and so many other things are going to be severely impacted and it\u2019s especially disheartening because it\u2019s happening in our third year.

And then come the insanely high costs of hiring white tie due to the \u201ctraditional\u201d dress code. I\u2019m sure everyone\u2019s trying their best but surely more can be done to make it more accessible for everyone and isolating students or making their experience lesser by charging ~\u00a3250 for guest tickets as well as an extra \u00a380 each for dining is unfair."

Unfortunately they need a bit of work to fit the tune, but here they are:\n\nVerse 1:\nI went to Oxford for a little look-see\nAnd found the colleges, so grand and fancy\nBut as I looked around, it made me feel blue\nFinancial inequalities, between colleges, oh what can we do?\n\nChorus:\nOld Trafford Christ Church, a beacon for the rich\nWhile others struggle to make ends meet, it's a glitch\nThe system's biased and not fair to all\nLeaving some with no choice but to crawl\n\nVerse 2:\nThe halls of power make the rules for the land\nLeaving some behind with no chance to stand\nWhile others go ahead and thrive\nLeaving some to struggle just to survive\n\nChorus:\nOld Trafford Christ Church, a beacon for the rich\nWhile others struggle to make ends meet, it's a glitch\nThe system's biased and not fair to all\nLeaving some with no choice but to crawl\n\nBridge:\nBut we won't stand still and be silenced\nWe'll raise our voices and be heard\nFor a world where financial equality reigns\nAnd every student's chance to succeed is gained\n\nChorus:\nOld Trafford Christ Church, no more a beacon for the rich\nAs fairness and equality take the pitch\nThe system's changed and now it's for all\nLeaving no one behind to fall\n\nOutro:\nSo come on, let's work together\nAnd make this world fair and better\nFor the students, for the land\nEquality for all, that's the plan."

In the meantime, as expected, college puffer discourse has been successfully poisoned by arguments about whether it's acceptable to wear them during VAC. ChCh puffers are a fairy tale, a joke; they laugh at what they should fear. This is good: they have their guards down, and they won't suspect a thing. Hilary Term will mark the return of the Christchurch Male, heed my words... Once I order the whole menu from every single independent restaurant... It will be chaos...

Ascend and traverse along the low lying wall which is situated beside the Rose Lane gate. It\u2019s adjoined to the small red tiled lodge.\n\n2. The perimeter wall dividing the meadow entrance and St. Aldates can be ascended (as mention in other comments). The access point is in the direction of St. Aldates police station and is concealed by bushes.\n\n3. To the rear of The Head of the River pub lies a footbridge, with a gateway that accesses the Christ Church Meadow Walk. Traversing to the left of the gate and vaulting the metal railings will give you access.\n\n4. The Trill Mill Stream is an underground stream which runs between Christ Church Meadows and Castle Mill Stream. It can be kayaked or walked depending upon the time of year. A little more extreme, but it makes for a fun adventure. It can be accessed from within the garden area of the Meadow. Waders are a must!\n\nNight Porters at the Meadow Entrance have been known to wander into the garden area after hours. So do your best to avoid this area until after 2am. Hope this helps."

To go against that and rinse students for money is just disgraceful.\n\nIt's part of a wider trend of the terrible communication and treatment of students (undergrads only in my experience although I'm sure it's not just limited to us) by the staff of St Peter's. From the ridiculously power hungry junior Dean, to the current issues with the bar and entz stuff, there is no respect shown to the jcr from the college administration, and no attempt with any of these issues to even try and talk to students about it.\n\nI still absolutely love our college, but very much in spite of the college administration. The JCR are amazing and our unique social life, the amazing bar and the loveliness of all undergrads to help each other still imo makes Peter's a beautiful place. But I really don't want to go back to college accommodation next year because of the honestly stupid prices, and I don't know what I'll do.\n\nTldr;\nOxhate to the Peter's administration and the accommodation prices.\nOxlove to the JCR and Peter's undergrads.\n\nHuge love in green and gold \ud83d\udd30"

Peters got people advertising on the telethon that building it was to help with access due to \u2018saving\u2019 people from private renting which is now obviously a lie. And the real kicker is they decided to make them double bed, en-suite rooms. It\u2019s a disgraceful addition to Peter\u2019s already abysmal accommodation set up."

Instead of Stock saying her views in an academic setting for critique, the alternative is alienating her within academic circles and forcing her to go to the metaphorical \u201cdark side\u201d I honestly think she is was workable but imperfect ally, as a lesbian herself.

It is a problem of bullying and respect. Prof Stock was invited because she represents one side of an active political debate in the UK, where both sides claim to be standing up for basic human rights. The Union thought a lot of members would be interesting in listening to her, whether they agree with her or not (I definitely don\u2019t), and I expect the event (if it happens) will indeed be packed. If you don\u2019t want to listen to Stock you don\u2019t have to attend. You will in no way be harmed simply because she gives a talk in the same city, even if you are trans and her talk is genuinely transphobic. Trying to deprive the option from all your fellow students (including trans students) who do want to listen to her through a campaign of bullying, harassment and e.g. banning the Union from the Freshers\u2019 Fair (something OUSU should not have the power to do for any student organisation, even a private club) is childish and deeply selfish. Try to have some basic respect for your friends and colleagues who have different views from you (including people from different backgrounds or faiths), and maybe don\u2019t be so entitled as to assume your own position is morally perfect, or that everything that offends you personally is \u201chate speech\u201d.

But occasionally when i really try to think about it, i do almost (ALMOST) understand all those professors who signed that letter; i do see that, by definition, free speech should go for everyone. However, that doesn't mean that people with views such as Stock's deserve platforms. Letting her give a speech (from what I can gather - i have never been to a union speech and probably never will) with little/no space for criticism is not necessarily what free speech is about. I think one can argue that freedom of speech would be being stifled if she was being told by students that she could never hold a speech in the city of Oxford or talk to someone about her views on the street, but the Union is a private institution. While I completely understand that hosting a speaker does not necessarily imply endorsement of their views, hateful messages shouldn't automatically deserve a platform on the basis of free speech. I don't think 'free speech is in peril', as the Telegraph put it. if she should be free to share her views on trans people then why are students not free to disagree? I don't think protesting against hate speech is authoritarian, and I doubt the media backlash would be anywhere near the same if it were another marginalised group (while I can't speak for some, as a woman I reckon it would be different if it were an academic who was forced to resign for being deeply misogynistic). I don't think anyone thinks that there should no longer be discussions about identities, sexualities and genders, and I also don't think that the vast majority of people in discussion of this issue would agree with the endangerment of safety to anyone concerned, but the trans community deserve to have their voices heard and their rights protected. it seems to me that the crux of this whole argument is that freedom of speech goes both ways, and while she is able to discuss on her platforms her personal views, those who disagree with them are also, equally able to say that they are not interested in hearing her views, which to me seems to be what is happening. it's not as though we're not being taught in tutorials on gender that it is a complex, multifaceted issue within which there are many diverse and conflicting views both within and outside the Western world, and if somebody is interested in hearing what Stock has to say, her books are in libraries. nobody is disputing that she doesn't have a right to put her opinions out there - it just seems like students are exercising their own freedom of speech to state that they disagree with the decision of the union to platform them, especially in a context where there is little room for contention."

Just as speakers should have the right to say whatever they wish to say \u2014 as this is an essential element of enlightened democracy and a central tenet of not only academic, but also political and even social discourse \u2014 so too should the people listening to these speakers have the right to question, critique, and disagree with opinions expressed. Hence, whilst Kathleen Stock\u2019s opinions on gender are distasteful to say the least, and even potentially harmful, surely we as a community cannot deny her right to voice these opinions? \u2014 doing so curtails dialogue and amounts to something akin to censorship, setting a dangerous precedent which potentially threatens the very basis of free discussion. If one may bar Kathleen Stock from speaking, and even seek to discourage the union from inviting controversial speakers by isolating the institution itself, what is stopping people from de-platforming speakers with less inflammatory views simply because a selection of individuals disagree with their views? That being said, Stock and the controversial speakers hosted by the union should not stand unopposed. Rather, the students of this university have a duty to challenge these speakers in order to expose the hypocrisy, or venom, of their positions. We cannot deny people the right to speak, but we can oppose the vehement rhetoric."

Your JCR elects members to represent them at Student Council. 2. These members vote on your behalf. 3. If you don't like that or want someone else to represent you, you're able to change it by voting them out. If 39 people went to vote, they're likely representing 39 colleges/common rooms. So if a majority of them vote, they're voting as a representative of their constituents. Abstaining is the same as not voting. Not turning up to vote is basically abstaining. If you care, engage and turn up or shut up. about 40% of ppl (who bothered to vote) voted for the Tory party which now controls 100% of government and basically dictate 100% of our laws. At least the SUs 78% of voters has a clear mandate unlike your Etonian brother in 2019...yes, I'm talking to you MD! Lets not pretend a referendum result on OU where all student vote directly would be in any way favourable to you or the Oxford Union, ptfff about a \"minority of students\"....by the same logic a minority of OU members voted you president! why haven't you resigned then?\ud83d\ude02"

It has employees. It is subject to no oversight from the central university or the SU.\n\nDue to this, it cannot be a student society. It is a business that runs for profit. As in, when it goes to the SU Freshers Fair they pay for a business-stand.\n\nThe SU voting to cut ties with the Union is, therefore, the same as the SU voting to no longer have anything to do with any other company - like Amazon, or Nandos. The reasoning behind the vote was not wanting to support or endorse the Union as a business.\n\nThe SU were not giving money to the Union or anything like that, they will simply no longer have official representatives of it at their events anymore.\n\nThe people who voted for this attended student council on Tuesday. It wasn\u2019t one sole group of friends banding together to \u2018take the Union down\u2019. These meetings are open to the public and every common room has votes to allocate. Many of the regular attendees of student council have held positions within the Oxford Union; this motion still passed with a massive majority.\n\nIf you don\u2019t like this decision and want to do something about it, you can go to the SU and get involved. This discussion was publicised in advance on the website and you can get involved by attending the next council meeting; everyone can go and every common room has votes. There has been a lot of misleading information and rumours so I am writing this to clear things up and tell you what has happened."

It's not right to let such an overwhelming minority of students decide what the SU's official relationship with a private membership club should be when such a relatively *high* proportion of Oxford students are members of said club. Whatever you feel about whether the Union should invite certain speakers or have a stand at freshers' fair, all students - both those who see it as toxic and those who enjoy being members - should have had the opportunity to vote on its ties with the wider uni. It's not the Union's fault that the SU's voting list \"might be updated\", get your shit together."

One only worked in it for three months\u2014 you define her as a \u201cpornstar\u201d rather than the other things she\u2019s done since\u2014 sports commentating, advocacy for Lebanese rights, and speaking out against the industry. The other is currently caught in the middle of a legal firestorm that caused the first criminal indictment of a former US president and she\u2019s been in plenty of mainstream media and tried to run for congress once. You referring to them by their work in the sex industry and only by that objectifies them more than their getting to speak at the union about those other things."

He is also a bit of a playboy, and he is not afraid to enjoy the finer things in life.\n\nI think these characters would be a good fit for the Oxford Union Society because they are all intelligent, ambitious, and confident.

The Union is not the President's personal project to do as he pleases - it's a private members club, and we, the members, have every right to raise concerns when events like yesterday's occur.\n\nLet's talk about the elephant in the room: the Israel Ambassador's invitation was problematic. It's not because she's Israel's ambassador, but because of who she is and what she stands for. Tzipi Hotovely is an ultra right wing politician who has described herself as \"a religious right winger\" and rejects the very existence of the Palestinian people. She supports the annexation of the entire West Bank and Gaza, and has an appalling record of racist and inflammatory behaviour.\n\nHundreds of British Jews signed a petition against her nomination as ambassador and there was a big protest the last time she was here. Yet our Union President saw fit to invite her again, just a few months after her last visit. She was not here for a dialogue, but to propagate her racist agenda. The last time she was here she received a red-carpet welcome with cherry-picked questions from the President. See the interview here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1zSHoXEFmw . And this time it was a panel discussion but where were the Palestinians in all of this? Why wasn't there any representation from the people most affected by her policies? If the President wanted a dialogue here, why were the Palestinians not represented?\n\nTo make matters worse, her security team manhandled and profiled students for \"security reasons\". Is this what we want our Union to be - a security state that discriminates against its own members? And why were there different standards - members with Palestinian stickers or symbols were not allowed in? Moreover, it is not the first time Union had high-profile speakers with security issues, but never had the members faced profiling or discrimination.\n\nIt's time for us to hold our Union President accountable and demand better. We cannot stay silent in the face of injustice and bigotry. Our Union is supposed to be a space for open dialogue and debate, not a platform for hate speech and discrimination. Let's stand together and make our voices heard - we deserve better than this. Sign the No Confidence Motion!"

Given the delicate nature of the Palestinian occupation, it\u2019s very dangerous to have state security recording individuals, esp those who are Palestinian, and could have very real consequences. The fact the Union did not consider the privacy and safety of their members, nor acknowledge post hoc what had happened nor make a statement saying they will do better is very concerning. There were members wearing a hijab or a keffiyeh who got to the door of the Union chamber last trinity, realised the state security were recording them and felt their safety would be threatened if they were to stay. No member should be made to feel this way, nor should the union have allowed it, especially as the members had not done anything to warrant being regarded as a threat that needed to be recorded or photographed."

The main proof of that is the fact that we are to impeach a president (partially)for what he\u2019s done as a Librarian. Needless to say, he is not responsible in any way for the way security \u201cmanhandled\u201d people, nor is he guilty for using \u201cyour excellency \u201c towards an ambassador, which, unfortunately, like it or not is still their title. The union is there for controversy, if you can\u2019t take it, don\u2019t go, but don\u2019t limit others people exposure to it. So before signing/voting for impeachment, think twice, especially since tonight is the anniversary debate which should celebrate diversity in ideas. Sincerely, A STEM student that is not involved in any way with Union\u2019s politics, but has opinions that matter none the less.

Those arguing from a religious perspective are motivated by dogma that cannot be reasoned against. This is how you look: Gay person: I would like to exist please. The right to be myself without facing discrimination would be nice also. Guest speaker: Your existence is a mistake and an affront to my religion. I disagree with you being the person that you are. This is why people are upset, because the topic of 'debate' is so often basically whether they should receive equal rights and civil liberties to anybody else. Some people love to claim they're \"just concerned\", like in the case of trans healthcare, but when you strip it back, usually this is a presentable way of saying these people make you uncomfortable by existing (which has no value in an argument, least of all silly little debates like the Union ones, where emotion is meant to be put aside because we're all so smart and logical)."

Ultimately when an arrogant, self-important person is invited to speak, applauded on entrance, made to sit at the front, given a microphone, and given the opportunity to present in such a grandiose building, how could they not see their presence and therefore ideas, as anything other than endorsed by the Union."

The Union hosting a motion which is actively been debated in the Church of England and other Christian denominations across the world is merely an acknowledgement that these debates are happening, if you'd rather silence the conversation and pretend like everyone is on board with LGBTQ+ rights you are delusional. For example only 55% of Anglicans believe same sex marriage is 'right', far from a consensus. Talking about LGBTQ+ rights, and debating the issues that are currently been discussed within and outside the community is important especially in an educational context such as in a debating society at University. I wanna be able to articulate the best possible arguments for religious same-sex marriages that I can, and seeing a debate on the issue is one of the best ways to get a grip on the topic and empower me to find the right words to speak up."

Let people call their largest event of the year a ball if they want to, as many many committees in Oxbridge do bc it appeals to people. Let them make decisions on alcohol, having alcohol at every paid event is not the inviolable right you think it is. Let them decide the price they\u2019ll set according to their demographic and their price sensitivity-if you don\u2019t want to pay for the experience, don\u2019t?? The idea of a \u201cnon drinking ball\u201d shouldn\u2019t trigger people nearly as much as it seems to-as a previous oxfess has mentioned, loads of people choose not to drink for all kinds of reasons (religion only being one-constantly screaming Puritanism is a disservice not just to everyone not drinking due to health, financial or other reasons but also to those who\u2019s relationship with their faith informs this decision, which isn\u2019t something that should be disrespected for no apparent reason??). I don\u2019t think that when we look back on our fondest moments here we\u2019re all able to recall exclusively the nights we spent absolutely pissed. It\u2019s a cool and accessible thing to have some diversity in events across the city, and my props to committees trying that- my support doesn\u2019t necessarily extend to any of the institutions they represent but I love them for trying something here. Hope to see one succeed at some point."

The drama this week reveals that. They cry because he didn't attend an access meeting, but ruin an entire access visit in the process. Access is a means to an end for them.\n\nOn the structure itself, just read the Cherwell article. It's a breeding ground for Westminster, arbitrary roles and rules to make them feel like they're important like my brothers in Christ you are in a university club not the NATO. Yes you're handling a budget, but 'authoritarianism'. Grow up.\n\nAnd for those looking for an alternative group, ultimately any group structured in that way will wind up working in the same way. Our only option would be for the other groups in Oxford primarily centred on either a political or marginalised groups (Femsoc, LGBTQ+ soc, ACS, 93%, OULC, OUCA, even the Lib Dems if we must, etc.) to join forces. Otherwise those minority viewpoints will slowly be forced out by zealous and loud people in any larger group, as it is in the union. That will probably never happen because there isn't the central admin or money that the union has, but it's a nice vision to see something that resembles an actual 'union' of people."

How on earth any future committees will be able to enact positive change, I do not know (although I really hope people will try, and eventually succeed). The lack of accountability and transparency is just so disappointing. The whole management hierarchy and structure of the system is really hindering respectful, transparent discussions and I genuinely hope that something is done to reform things to try and enable people to do their jobs, benefit from being involved and improve members' experiences, rather than having to waste so much time and effort on things that lead to no results, constant hostility and must be emotionally draining.

I know people pretend not to care but then they pore over the drama or complain about it's cliques/elitism/[insert negative trait]; that's not not caring, that's not liking but you still care. It just seems like the whole university goes through waves of periodically ironically engaging in the Union's bullshit, then forgetting it's ironic and just engaging, then back to purported irony. If we all actually just stopped, it wouldn't have enough interest to sustain itself. Sure, the die-hards would keep at it for a while but they'd have to give up eventually, because the incentives (based on connections/power/pretending not to be a lizard in a human suit by hiding in a crowded chamber) would diminish with the number of participants. It's a bit like Instagram, if we all agreed it was valueless, it would lose it's power over us. Can we try? Apart from anything else, just imagine how satisfying it would be to see all the sad, deflated hacks who put all their time into it and then realise they're actually just a bunch of overgrown teenagers playing parliament, unsure if they actually have any friends (lizard people don't count). If things got really good, they would have to start selling the land or something to remain solvent: imagine! I'm finishing this year and my intention is to rid my Facebook friends list of Unionites about as thoroughly as a dictator purges intellectuals and artists from a failed state; if anyone wants to get me a graduation gift, just deliberately avoid anything to do with the Union, pretend it doesn't exist. If nothing else, it would be so funny to watch them crumble."

Sometimes I make them write a long apology, then share it in the \"Hackfest\" groupchat (highly recommend), and we all laugh at the depths of humiliation which the hacks are willing to sink to to secure my vote! I have hacks take me for coffee couple of times in a week and invite me for formals - obviously, because I want to get to know them better and find out how can I support their slate! I trick them into writing sob stories about how they finally want to amount to something, I mock their useless 40% acceptance rate degree, I make fun of their slate name. They aren't offended - in fact, the more I humiliate them, the more they want my vote? I pit them against each other, saying \"oh but you know, your friend X has already secured my vote\". They go nuts. They write paragraphs about how they always thought they're my best friend. Hacks are so fun.

It feels like if I'd attend these balls I'm indirectly supporting societies which weren't able to deal with issues such as harassment, sexual assault and discrimination in the correct way.\n\nIf you see someone against participating at these events, remember this aspect too. I'm not a person of strong principles, but at the same time, it's hard not to be disgusted by the repeated inability to deal with these situations. Yes, there will always be failures in dealing with such issues (we are not anywhere near perfect; even the university is not doing great in that regard, that shows it has its own problems), but having a problem like this almost every single term is a sign of something being wrong with the culture and enviroment of that society.\n\nTake care everyone, and I don't condemn anyone who is attending or wishes to, but keep this in mind."

Drinks never ran out, Oxford bands & dancers were great as usual, trippy light displays, silent disco til 6am, Mura Masa didn\u2019t play his own songs but the mix was good. Main issue was the queuing. Oh my god the food queues. Waiting an hour for a tiny portion was enough for people to decide to go hungry for the rest of the night. (Same for the swings, the shisha bar before everyone just sat wherever, and some of the bars). Security-wise, it\u2019s so funny that the Oxfess about organisers spreading fake info about security (like the sniffer dogs) to scare people breaking in was true. Checking wristbands between quads was both annoying and didn\u2019t work. Also security talking about tackling people\u2026 not on. The layout was weird because in theory you couldn\u2019t do a loop of the college because Tommy White Quad was closed but porta-potties weren\u2019t really signposted so people broke into Tommy White and used that for toilets. Also the fact that for part of the night, two men weren\u2019t allowed on the swings until they proved they were gay\u2026 None of that really ruined the night though."

All this following no real communication or marketing before the event. Very poor show from Oxford\u2019s richest college - especially with how high the ticket prices were. Also what happened to the theme? Went from art nouveau tarot cards to just generic sort of pagan solstice vibes? Did someone try to badly rip off Wadham ball from last year last minute? Did the committee even communicate?? Also the over the top checking of wristbands in EVERY SINGLE QUAD. You closed your doors at 9, so after that point how could people have snuck in?

For months said committee members have been talking about how they were only on committee so they would get free tickets and boasted that they never went to committee meetings. When a first yeargot too drunk on the night and her friends asked one of them where the first aid was they replied something along the lines of \u2018F*** knows, the ball\u2019s started, I\u2019m only here to have a good time\u2019.

Our *B* team is arguably the fourth best team in the history of UK student quizzing, behind our A team, C*mbridge and Balliol (when we submitted colleges). Without wanting to brag, the college entrances for Uni challenge massively disadvantages us. We are simply better at quizzing than everyone else and would win every year if we submitted a single team, so I\u2019d be seriously careful what you wish for."

It's inaccurate, fearmongering, and frankly if people are actually developing jaundice, posting about it as if it's just a piece of scandalous gossip is disrespectful to the people who have contracted something which could potentially be serious.\n\nFirst of all, stop talking as if jaundice is contagious in the way that the common cold is. The only way people can \"spread\" jaundice is through hepatitis, which in turn is spread through blood or bodily fluids i.e. most likely sex. Hepatitis can lead to liver cancer or liver failure in some cases. If there is genuinely jaundice (i.e. hepatitis) going around, the most sensible thing to do is to get tested and maybe take a step back from having sex with people who you don't know too well and may potentially be carrying.\n\nTldr jaundice at Baliol isn't \"spreading\" in the way covid does, it spreads through sex and can be serious, if you're worried then get tested."

When I walked by him, I looked up at the exact same spot. I had a view of a girl in a short skirt standing at the top of the staircase, which can be seen from outside from the bottom. I returned to the same spot 10 minutes later to double check, and the man was still in the same spot looking up at the same skirt. I called up the porter at Balliol immediately but was told to call a different location instead since it is out of their proximity. I'm not sure why the burden has to be on me if I was simply reporting what I saw for the sake of the safety of the students they should be protecting \ud83e\udd37 Girls, please be alert when using those stairs."

Nope, we're talking a full-blown, high stakes, no-holds-barred takeover of the University.\n\nThe master plan? Every college to be renamed in honour of Brasenose. Picture it: Brasenose East (formerly Christ Church), Brasenose West (formerly Magdalen), and my personal favourite, Brasenose-in-the-Vale (formerly, you guessed it, Somerville). There's already a campaign for the Rad Cam to be christened the \"Rad Brasenose.\"\n\nAnd don't get me started on the dress code. \"Subfusc? More like sub-fail,\" the new regime says. From now on, it's Brasenose-themed onesies for all examinations. Tripos in a unicorn onesie? Don't mind if I do.\n\nRumour has it, they're even replacing Latin grace in hall with a recitation of the lyrics to \"Sweet Caroline,\" because, you know, 'B-N-C'. It's all in the name of tradition, they insist.\n\nBut fear not, dear Oxford, for there is a way out of this impending chaos. If we can beat them at the annual tortoise race, the takeover gets called off. So, if you have a speedster tortoise hidden away somewhere, now would be a good time to bring it forth."

I must confess, my dear friends, that I have committed the crime of stealing the Dean's toupee.\n\nNow, I know what you may be thinking. \"How could a genius such as yourself stoop so low as to steal a toupee?\" But I must tell you, dear friends, that I was inebriated beyond belief. I had just finished a night of heavy drinking with my fellow physics enthusiasts, and I stumbled upon the Dean's office. There it was, sitting on top of his bookshelf, glimmering in the moonlight.\n\nAnd so, I took it. I don't quite remember why, but I took it. I must have thought it was a necessary experiment in the field of physics, or maybe I was just trying to prove my superior intellect.\n\nBut let me tell you, my dear friends, it was not worth it. The next morning, I woke up to find the toupee sitting on my pillow, and five emails demanding an explanation.\n\nSo, here I stand, confessing to my crime. I can only hope that the Dean will show mercy and not expel me from the prestigious institution that is Brasenose.\n\nIn conclusion, I urge all of you to not follow in my footsteps. The toupee stealing business is not worth it, trust me.\n\nYours,\nThe Toupee Bandit"

That's both against our contract and literally not legal for landlords to impose a random charge for extra cash whenever they want. They say they consulted \" a student representative\" and yet no one from the JcR committee has mentioned it or questioned it at all when I really think they should be.

Because of course religious affiliation is never corrupt. The JCR may be brilliant or it may be awful but regardless surely it should be secular with no religious bias. It\u2019s bad enough that we can\u2019t opt out of getting emails from the chaplain despite not all being religious, and that someone with such a profoundly religious position is deemed to be appropriate outlet for welfare concerns beyond religion. You are going to protest against a cliquey JCR by creating a religiously affiliated one? Definitely doesn\u2019t sound like a cult."

There\u2019s a point where microaggressions just turn into plain macroaggressions and the CCR page will not condone it. Successive incoming cohorts will choose to be members of the CCR over the JCR if it continues in this direction without repercussion, it is change or extinction.

The really unusual thing is the acceptance rate: you've been #1 for the last DECADE (2020 incl.) after being, let's face it, a bit of an average nothing college before that. This is probably very boring for most people but, I can't lie, I'm baffled. BNC's acceptance rate for 2018-2020 is 9%, making it Oxford's most desirable, hardest to get in to college: HOW?? WHY??

Straight away, in the Front Quad, after I scraped some Corpus Day debris off my shoe, I found a trough of evidence for your claim: a sloppy bowl of unfinished porridge oats, set upon a plant pot (indeed, set to the height of a pig). In fact, the meal is still there over an hour later, which I note only as proof that no one came back to finish their slop.\n\nNow, we all know that sloppy quad porridge alone cannot make a sty of a whole college, even a college that dedicated its name to someone who was literally born in a barn. I duly chalked it off as \u201cstrike one\u201d for the day, but piggy little hoofs were now firmly in my mind.\n\nSo, I took my unbothered facade to the Corpus Christi Toilet, and lo\u2014in this second bowl I found: a big, filthy, unflushed shit. Recoiling, I stepped back from the pungent, wretched fog they left behind, only for my foot to land with cushioned horror upon a pile of used paper towels that tickled their way inside my trouser leg like a drove of truffle-hunting snouts, grunting and snortling at my exposed calf. They say pigs will eat anything. I screamed.\n\nStill, I resolved to clear away this Corpus Oinker\u2019s mess before the scouts arrived. Soon enough, no plausible excuses remained for this apparent act of piggery. Most importantly, lest I forget, and I regret to add: the flush worked fine. I know this because I flushed it. Nor did the vile loaf then struggle to clog itself for the joy of stealing one more breath of our surface air. Rather, it flushed with grace, just as you or I might slip down a five-star ride at Alton Towers.\n\nBut they didn\u2019t even try to flush. I'm sure of it. Flushing never trotted through their porcine mind. Did they even wipe? The scarcity of paper in the bowl should give us pause. But we can be sure of this much\u2014their lifestyle of filth must stop. I do not know your name, villain, but I know your soul: you are a beast of a Corpuscle. Worse, I fear you are not alone.\n\n(TL;DR @ CCC babes - tidy up, wipe your bum, flush the loo.)"

Even though BME people who don't even celebrate the festival are allowed to go to the celebration, white Hindus are not welcome and that just seems so unfair to me. I get so few opportunities to celebrate the culture and faith I was raised in and was hoping this might be a good opportunity, but no. Adoptees literally get the worst of both worlds - we don't know the culture we were born in, and we're rejected from the culture we were raised in."

Hart Hall was founded in the 1280s, became Hertford College in 1740 but was DISSOLVED in 1816. No money, no leadership. Gone. Forever. An entirely different foundation (!), your true forebears, Magdalen Hall, was founded in the 1480s. In the 1820s Magdalen Hall revamped those destitute former Hertford College buildings and moved there cuz they needed a sweet new home. Then, in the 1870s Magdalen Hall wanted to become a College, too. Ohh shoot! Magdalen College already existed! So they needed a different name. And they chose to name it Hertford College just cuz half a century ago a flimsy College with that name existed around there. This means the present day Hertford College has nothing to do with Hart Hall founded in the 1280s and has everything to do with Magdalen Hall founded in the 1490s."

It's almost always free and always clean. Although there are two minor downsides. It's a bit warm in the latter half of Trinity, though not too bad. Also if you don't know what time to use it, you can get locked in the building, in which case you'll face the embarrassment of the porter coming to save you. Have your phone with you if you don't wanna be banging on the glass door for someone to save you.\n\nCheng Hub 4.5/5:\n\nLess private than the Habakkuk Room as the Hub gets quite busy sometimes and the toilets get frequently used, but it's also a little cleaner than Habakkuk. The biggest downside is that it's hard to get WiFi.\n\nCheng Cafe 4/5\n\nPossibly the third least private, as it's a single toilet surrounded by the cafe itself, and you can hear everyone. This is a major downside, but otherwise the toilet is like the Hub one with WiFi.\n\nMCR 3.5/5\n\nI don't use this that often, but as the MCR is usually dead, it's generally private. Although it's still a bit bad looking and uncomfortable.\n\nStaircase V 3/5\n\nSame as MCR, except less clean, and feels more out in the open because it's in the First Quad.\n\nJCR: 2.5/5\n\nThe second least private as the JCR is relatively active, always smells bad, and always feels dirty. Also the motion sensor can't be triggered from inside the cubicle, so if it's the evening prepare for total darkness after a few minutes.\n\nBar 2/5\n\nAlthough I'm sure this toilet is sometimes private and clean, it never is when the bar is active, which is when you'd wanna use it anyway. So when you do go here it'll be incredibly busy. Go to Cheng Hub instead.\n\nLibrary 0.5/5\n\nWhat is this? Why does this toilet exist? The sink is so small and the pressure is so high I can't even wash my hands here. Not private, not clean, and the size of a locker room. Also surprisingly frequently used, and some people are incapable of locking the door. I want to forget this toilet exists."

The caf\u00e9 (which was in the Douglas Price Room back then) was always popular with people who could do work there while having something to eat or drink from the caf\u00e9. The pizza bar (also known as the Red Brick Oven) was popular in the evening, including on Saturdays when people would often use the bar and have a pizza. It was still open on Saturdays in early 2020 as I remember visiting Oxford on a Saturday in late February 2020 and having a pizza there; there were a number of others also having pizza. However, when I was in Oxford on a Saturday this February, I popped in to Keble only to find that the caf\u00e9 and pizza bar are closed on Saturdays. Why was this decision taken, depriving Keble students of somewhere to get food while they work during the day and of somewhere to meet up and have pizza in the evening?"

So the students ignore the dean's welfare list (not that it should be their responsibility) and pitch the entire undergraduate body against eachother for threee days straight while loads of us have jobs and don't have time to re-organise our corridors every hour and a half on a weekday. absolute joke"

This whole situation has been making me feel so sad and unwell because I just can\u2019t deal with all of this uncertainty. How does the college expect us to do well when they do everything in their power to stress us out and make us more anxious. If you are a prospective student trawling the pages of oxfess deciding on which college to apply to DO NOT APPLY TO KEBLE! Keble doesn\u2019t care about its students and it never has done. I\u2019m going into my final year and this college has done nothing but make our lives more difficult and unpleasant my whole time here. The students are amazing and lovely but I can\u2019t in good faith encourage anyone to apply here again and will not be doing outreach work promoting the college again. A college that claims to care about their students well being and yet refuses to communicate with students directly, messes students around for 10 months and won\u2019t give them any sense of security going into their final year. It\u2019s despicable."

After speaking to my tutors in college about it and hearing their stories from other colleges, it really is night and day when comparing how Mansfield admissions tutors approach a state school application vs a private school application. The scoring takes into account seriously (as opposed to in a tokenistic fashion) the tangible disadvantages of applying from a poor state school, of disabilities, of lack of access to interview or admissions test practice. I completely agree with you that in the money sense, Mansfield is an abysmal choice for students from low-income households, when compared to the financial support on offer at a place like ChCh. However, disappointingly, Mansfield is one of the few colleges putting in the hard work into making the admissions stage fairer. It\u2019s not right, but the truth is, many of us know that we would not have got in elsewhere, not because of our lack of ability, but because of tutors at other colleges refusing to take privilege into account, or refusing to take it into account enough. While the points you make are reasonable and important, I don\u2019t think I\u2019d, in good faith, be able to recommend a state school applicant, especially a low income applicant, to apply anywhere else apart from Mansfield for these reasons. As soon as other colleges up their game in the admissions area though, then yeah fair enough, I think other, richer colleges become a far better shout for low income applicants"

No one is trying to take away your gowns, I still plan on wearing my commoners one bc I like the tradition but some people may not feel comfortable showing what grade they got in prelims so visually - you don't know the circumstances behind someone's prelims grade. Also the whole idea that I don't like x so no one can have x (or vice versa) is problematic at the best of times and that seems to be the only argument I've seen so far as to why gowns should be mandatory. Keep wearing your gowns if you want to, I personally love seeing them being worn, but let others make the choice on whether they wear theirs or not, have some empathy"

I am pleased to report that our recent theft of the beaver has thrown them into a frenzy, and they are surely scrambling to come up with a response. However, we cannot rest on our laurels. We have heard rumors that St Anne's are planning to steal my beloved brother, Professor Biscuit, and myself. As an admiral, I have faced many foes on the high seas, but none quite as ridiculous as this. I will not stand for this affront to our honor and dignity as cats and members of the St Hugh's community. We cats are not pawns to be used in their silly little game. I must address the issue of the beaver. Yes, we may have taken it from St Anne's, but let's face it, they were asking for it. That beaver was clearly in need of a new home, and we simply provided it with one. It's not our fault that St Anne's is so attached to their beaver, but they should have known better than to leave it unguarded. So, my fellow felines, let us not forget why we are fighting. We are fighting for our pride, our honor, and our right to sleep for 18 hours a day without disturbance. We will not let St Anne's take what is rightfully ours, and we will not back down from this war. Let us show them that we will not be cowered by their silly pranks and attempts at stealing our most prized possessions. We will rise victorious from this feud."

Personally I also felt for most of Michaelmas term like I\u2019d missed out on the chance to make close friends during all the freshers\u2019 week clubbing, but in hindsight there really wasn\u2019t anything to worry about - I got closer to existing friends and made new friends throughout Hilary term, 2nd year, 3rd year, and beyond. You could even find friends that you eventually feel comfortable going sober clubbing with, like I did!\n\nI\u2019ve probably been projecting my fresher experiences onto a random Oxfess, but hopefully this can help anyone who\u2019s reading this and also feeling FOMO. Having an underwhelming freshers\u2019 week doesn\u2019t mean anything in the grand scheme of things, I promise :)"

It's supposed to be an event UNIQUE to Anne's (and Somerville of course) that couldn't happen anywhere else--not some random Tuesday night in Atik. upset. if there are legit reasons behind the decisions, let us know."

Do people bring family or just go with friends who are at somerville or just friends from other colleges? Or romantic partners visiting? Would it be weird if i went with my family?

Whether it's ordering Ubereats coco-pops or being unbearably cruel to a girl with mh issues, there is a clear disconnect from the real world. I am surrounded by people with overwhelming privilege and conceit who have had their hands held through the system and will continue to prosper off the backs of others.

So whilst I might not want to condemn you for the KS invitation, God forbid I defend you in any sense as it would be viewed as a cosignatory to other toxic things I and the general majority of student hates about you and want to condemn/have you abolished for: excessiveness and obsessiveness hacking and hacks, dirty politics, the myriad of scandals, links to dodgy organisations, the list goes on! Things your existence as the \"last bastion of free speech\" allow you to escape being held accountable in part thanks to a stellar PR team but also because idiots in JCRs and the SU helping prop up the right-wing narrative of freedom of expression being under attack with silly motions that say a lot but don't lead to anything except boost your notoriety."

Ignoring or deflecting the fact that you are okay with 12,000 deaths this winter during the cost of living crisis caused by Truss' government just shows you are unwilling to accept that your party is not always perfect, and presents you not only as malicious but also dense.\n\nOxhate to the completely inconsiderate article they posted about abortion rights - the date that this was posted being so close to the overturning of Roe v Wade was completely inappropriate, and incited fear in many vulnerable women. If threatening women's feelings of comfort and safety is appropriate to you, you are a misogynist, regardless of your gender.\n\nAnd finally, Oxhate to the defensive comments that I know will appear on this post.

For YEARS students have been demanding Oxford rename institutions, and the counterargument is always the same: 'we cannot hide the history of these places'. Renaming colleges/scholarships/libraries based on modern financial donations entirely undermines this idea and puts a price on the well-being of students. 'We cannot hide the history of these places without financially profiting from that action'. What makes Linacre different from Rhodes and Codrington? Are POC livelihoods at Oxford University worth less than \u00a3155 million? This action continues to confirm that the answer is yes."

It's a Vietnamese surname; the Sino-Viet character for Thao \u8349 means grass (\"grass college\") (if we go one step further, \u8349 means lol/lmao in Japanese slang - \"lol college\"); with \u8349 comes a new symbol/logo for the college; it's coincidentally a Thai honorific (\"lord/lady\"); an aboriginal group in Taiwan; sounds like the Greek letter Tau (physics, maths, etc); and sounds a little like Taoist Tao (\"the way\"). So many possibilities and new directions! From Taoist Tao and Greek Tau especially there's so much symbolism and wordplay that can be had... way more than the name of some 15th century dude."
