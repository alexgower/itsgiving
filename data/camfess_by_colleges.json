We've been texting all summer and she confessed she has a crush on me. At first I was ecstatic that she shared my feelings but then I asked - but aren't you gay? And she said that she is but I'm the exception because I'm so great and \"still have lady parts\". I feel so conflicted - I am so happy she is into me but I feel like she doesn't think of me as a man and sees me as a lesbian\u2026 any advice?

When I worked camp, we were working 12-16 hours a day, with one day off every two weeks. The pay, when you take account of that many hours, was less than minimum wage. We also had to pay for our own dbs checks which were docked from wages, despite the fact that our contracts said they would cover expenses like that. The kids themselves were *mostly* fine. They are from very wealthy backgrounds, and act like it, but most are alright. But when you do get a bad one, its awful. The camp is getting too much money to kick them out so nothing is done lest the parents complain- I won't go into the incident I'm referring to because it was awful but suffice to say the police should have been involved and weren't called. Then there's the fact that in many of these jobs you're the 'welfare' person. Its important to note that most courses you have a site manager and a deputy, and then your student workers. That's it. You're left to deal with these kids mental health without any support, and the extra stress on them from being away from home means that sometimes very serious incidents occur. I ended up with one of these, and was offered support only by my fellow student workers not management. Its great if you had a good experience, but personally I could never in good faith recommend working one of these courses. They're cash grabs for management, and student workers are left to deal with very serious child protection issues which should be left to professionals."

      "None": "Following #Camfession41160, things I wish I'd heard as an undergrad:\n\n1. It's okay to not force a friend group, and to focus on quality over quantity in friends. \n2. You don't have to feel guilty about going out for days in a row, or feel like you're not having enough fun because you've worked for the last 3 days. It's all about balance. \n3. Social media is a lie. In Cambridge it's an even bigger lie.\n4. Everyone is still growing, learning, changing etc. You'll drift in and out of connections and friendships, partly because you are becoming different people. \n5. Relationships, dating and meeting people are often seen as a big part of uni life. They can enrich your experience, but if it doesn't happen, it doesn't happen, and that's okay. Equally, if you do end up in a relationship, this can be amazing, but also please look after yourself, maintain those friendships (please do not drop your friends), and keep doing you- you were a person before the relationship, and you will be one after. \n6. Breakups are hard wherever you are, but in a tiny place like Cambridge, where everyone knows everyone, and it's hard to get space, they can be even harder :( Take as much time as you you need, and don't feel like you need to rush the healing just because of how fast-paced term life is.\n7. Take BREAKS. Like actually. Especially over the summer and in holidays. Reconnect with home friends, family, family friends\u2026 whatever makes you happy! Live for a bit outside the bubble.\n8. Work as you go along. Cannot emphasise this enough. From a humanities student, actually read and research for your essay every week, write notes, gather material. It will mean revising is simply shortlisting and cutting down notes you've already made. So much easier and the absolute key to success and not feeling super overwhelmed just before exams.\n9.  Try things! Try going out, try extracurriculars even if you don't think you'll be good at them, say yes to things- take risks. Lots won't pay off, but some will, massively. You never know what you might end up loving, and you never know what amazing people you might meet. \n10. There unfortunately are, like everywhere, some toxic, not-so-nice people here. You won't get on with everyone. Friendships you thought you'd leave with will end. People can be cruel. Behaviour will get tolerated. But there are also incredibly kind, fun, hilarious and interesting people out there too. \n11. Please do not compare. It is the absolute worst thing you can do. Don't compare your grades, your social life, your dating life, what job offer someone has. Everyone is going at their own pace and has completely different priorities in life. Some people really want to leave with a relationship, some people are focused on getting a friend group, others put all their time into extracurriculars. You can't do everything, and you do not have to juggle it all at once. Remember everyone else is in the same boat. \n12. Lastly, remember that everyone has a unique uni experience. It might not be what you expected, and it's okay to feel sad that you didn't get everything you wanted out of it. But you should also appreciate the moments where you achieved things, or experienced things you never thought you would. \n\nHave the best 3 years here!"

Get reading stuff that are not on the reading list not just for extra credit but for wider knowledge \n2. If you think a supervisor is a bit dodge chances are you are right. Don't let that decide your experience with the paper. Supervisors are temporary, grades are unfortunately forever \n3.join any society that will take your mind off work. This is essential. \n4.keep a fairly busy schedule that includes non-negotiables like when you have lunch, hanging out with friends etc\n5. Keep and re-read essay feedback even when it's painful, there is some truth in most feedback \n6.make friends on your course and also make friends on OTHER courses\n7.you must never be afraid to ask for help, it is rarely offered so freely at university\n8. If you can secure notes and help from older years,do so promptly like in Michaelmas\n9.work out why you are being taught said papers. They all have a purpose even if it doesn't seem so. Also there is always a reason why a paper is compulsory, pay good attention you'll need it later.\n10. have some long term goals beyond grades. You might not end up doing them but it certainly helps to motivate you.\n11. Don't bother with people who continually compare \n12. This is a hard one to say BUT if you feel that you must intermit. Do so, don't worry about your friends graduating that isn't the most important thing, you are :) \nP.S you'll be okay\n13. try and get outside as much as possible \n14. Go to social events\n15. Write for something else that isn't your degree (very humanities directed) it really improves your writing \n16. Your opinions matter but in the context of what you have read so get reading \n17. You are allowed to say no and sit some things out.\n18. keep in touch with someone outside of uni, they'll be a breath of fresh air\n19. You can do absolutely anything if you really really wish, nothing is too good for you and no one is inherently better than you. Don't let academics' opinions of your potential decide for you\n20. Keep your head up. You are a Cambridge student, what a legend. \n\nBest of luck to you and all your endeavours and if you can complete this, then the world is most definitely your oyster!"

I am a second-year PhD candidate at the Faculty of Education conducting a study about the sense of belonging among first-generation women students at Cambridge. I am looking for women from underrepresented backgrounds (e.g., state-school and BAME students) to discuss their experiences here. I also speak to their mothers to understand the family's support in their children's educational journeys. So far, I have interviewed very inspirational women, but I am struggling to find a couple more.\n\nAs a student parent with experiences overlapping both mothers and daughters participating in my research, I can relate to my participants on a personal level. This connection helps ensure that conversations, while in-depth, are relaxed and informal. Participants will be anonymised to ensure your privacy.\n\nPlease get in touch with amd218 if you did your undergrads at Cambridge in the 21st century. If you are still an undergrad but think you have something to say about belonging, please get in touch too.\n\nThank you!"

I didn't understand anything and was really struggling. Third year I came very bottom of the 2.1s, and in my fourth I ended up on a 2.2, and was disappointed. But I finally found something I enjoyed and was good at which I did for my project. My supervisor was still happy to take me for the PhD. Now I've just had my first paper accepted and I'm submitting a second one next week.\nThe point is, you might feel like you're failing now, like nothing's gonna work out and you're the stupidest person in your year. But people are genuinely right, things will get better. Just go out there and find what you're good at and what you enjoy.

I'm in something of a similar position myself although not a finalist (high 2:1 given very extenuating circumstances which affected both academics and socialising when others were able to enjoy their time and work hard while I was completely in survival mode and my parents have no understanding for how it feels to feel like a \"failure\" even when you are objectively doing very well and my college has been dismal) so I fully understand that anything anyone says won't take away from what you're feeling deep down.

Why us a lifelong friend considered to be more important than a friend youvebonly known for a couple of years. I had people who I got on with really well at Cam and who I remain in touch with on some level. What I've learnt is that most people are in your life for periods of time and when you move on you meet new people who are just as nice but you have more in common with because you are at the same point.

If the disparity was greater than that the markers met and discussed and if they still disagreed a third marker was called to mark blindly and this was resolved with their intervention. The only downside can be that more senior academics tend to strong arm the junior... I would strongly urge you to start a formal issue regarding marking, involve your reps, your college, find sympathetic staff etc. They won't do anything unless there is a lot of pressure and it persists."

Then, on results day, I find out I got a 60 in said paper.\n\nThe next day, I requested my notesheets for said exam, and found this out (see pictures below). Since the exams for my course are double-marked, there are two notesheets. For the second question in particular, the first examiner gave me a 46 (a THIRD) and the second examiner gave me a 72 (a First) for the same question\u2026 just how is this possible? How can one faculty have such stark disparities in marking?

However my insecurities would always get the better of me; I suffer from abandonment issues due to past friendships and relationships and I ended up ruining this friendship by carrying those anxieties. Similarly because I felt he was so much better than me I tried to overcompensate too much and became overly needy and needing to feel validated and I know that drove him away. My graduation is in a few days but I couldn't be any less excited. I'm crying myself to sleep most nights and as much as I try to distract myself, I keep beating myself over what I could've done differently to not lose him as a friend.

I didn't drink much though. \n\nI think most people find it cool, but a large minority look down on it like you. Which is totally fair, it's absolutely selfish. I want to spin it as a form of protest against a tradition that pressures people to waste their money on gross excess, but that wasn't my intention. \n\nI would rather not attend the balls than pay to attend. And if I was caught I would have happily left and probably been glad to get to bed.\n\nPersonally, the other big reason why I sneak in is because I feel too insecure in my friendships to make big plans way ahead of time like that.

I don't understand why he wants their validation when he already has a very active social life and I'm worried that that culture of binge drinking and peer pressure to 'be the big man' will make him act differently.\n\nAlso, we're both going into our final years next year and he's already expressed concerns about how he's going to manage his degree work with sport, and various committees, and seeing his normal friends, and now the drinking soc events (not to mention seeing me lol). I don't see how this extra social commitment won't eat into our already limited time together in a busy Cambridge term. He's planning to do the initiation next term - is it ok that I'm trying to talk him out of it?

It is a very successful choir and provides opportunities for female singers of all vocal types, while the main college choir does not include sopranos, limiting opportunities for women. Indeed, there is currently only one female singer in St John's College Choir. The statement put out by John's regarding music in the college (https://www.joh.cam.ac.uk/music-college-st-johns-statement) implies SJV is sucking up resources which could instead be used for more accessible music opportunities including 'masterclasses in music, for example on song writing' and supporting 'new opportunities for non-auditioned singing'. The implication seems to be that SJV is somehow elitist. Additionally, the statement claims 'Students' preferences and experiences in music today are different from those of previous generations, and many of them have had fewer musical opportunities in school than might have been the case in the past.' This implies SJV essentially is being scrapped because state schools are failing to provide music opportunities and training to pupils. This is pretty sad and illogical if true. Additionally, the college stresses in the statement the 'significant resources currently devoted to St John's Voices', but I wonder how much the choir really costs to run. The whole move to scrap SJV seems rather underhanded and I don't see why a high-level choir like SJV cannot coexist with more accessible music opportunities, especially in a college as rich as St John's.",

It's the system.\nMore specifically, May Balls are problematic because:\n- they bring private security guards into people's homes (remember college is some people's year-round home)\n- they kick students out of their rooms (shoutout to colleges that don't do this)\n- they generate large amounts of waste (even compostable packaging still generally ends up in landfill)\n- they cement and make obvious Cambridge's gaping class divide\n- they foster a collective delusion that \u00a3100+ is a reasonable amount to pay for one night. At any other university in the UK minus Oxford, students would rightly wince at an event over \u00a350\n- the noise\nIf you quietly agree with this but feel like everyone's going to a ball, rest assured you're not alone! So many students don't, and never, go to the balls, and instead have delightful May Weeks year-after-year at the free or reasonably priced events, hanging out with friends, working on the causes they believe in, and/or making the most of the beauty of Cambridge in the sunshine."

      "None": "Cutting the queue at may balls is perhaps the ultimate test of the character of a Cambridge student:\n\n-Anyone can do it, fairly easily, and knows they probably won't get ejected or turned around. The worst that can happen is someone arguing with them, which rarely happens and wouldn't force them back anyway. This would be different if colleges enforced this with actual consequences, but they tend not to.\n-It's easy to do mental gymnastics to justify it (\"Somebody else did it\", \"I had a reason for being late\", \"It's not that deep\", \"This one person I technically know is standing near where I cut in\"). These are bullshit and don't need to be refuted, but since some of the people reading this are said queue-cutters, I'll point out that you could just as well go BACK in the queue to join your friends (I do this when necessary), or even (nobody does this) both move to the middle of your two locations, both of which would be much less disrespectful to those around you. Additionally, any amount of \"deep\" or \"not that deep\" that \"it\" is equally describes the impact to you of just joining the queue like a normal person.\n-The consequences of cutting the queue are plainly visible: everyone who's being inconvenienced is standing right there. You could even count them if you felt like it.\n-It's well-known that (unless you bought a queue jump or dining ticket or something, in which case you wouldn't be there anyway) everybody paid the same amount and has the exact same goal. Any particular justification the queue-cutter makes up doubtless applies to quite a few people behind them who haven't cut.\n-The queue-cutter's behavior relies entirely on other people being less selfish and not just cutting in front of them later. It is possible only because the person who does it is more selfish than their peers.\n-Everyone had the exact same opportunity to show up whenever they pleased and join the queue. There was no random or favoristic allocation of queue positions.\n-Finally, cutting the queue is plainly visible (and annoying) to all the people waiting. There is no way to hide or misrepresent the behaviour to onlookers, making those who do it truly impervious to both internal conscience and external judgement.\n\nOn further thought, this isn't *just* a reflection on a given student's character, but on the fact that they live a life either by privilege or by chosen associations where they're protected from social consequences for being a dick. I thought about ending this with \"Do better.\", but I have no hope, so I'll just stop here."

One of them was tethered directly in the bright sun, which was so blazing this afternoon that I had to look for shade after 30 minutes in it started to make me feel faint. I can't imagine how that would affect the sensitive eyes of a creature adapted to live in the darkness. The owls were also all surrounded by students, who did their best to be respectful as far as I saw but did get quite close to get photos sometimes and were naturally having fun (as they should be!) so were sometimes a bit tipsy and having loud conversations, not to mention the noise from the main band across the garden. One of the birds looked visibly distressed at points, but the keeper was busy with a queue of students waiting to take photos with the owls on their arms and didn't check on the tethered birds once that I could see in the 30 minutes I was there.",

There weren't any academic/health reasons so put it down as MH for the EAMC (not entirely untrue as the family situation had aggravated a lot of cPTSD stuff that I was previously managing). Returning to the abuse felt like the path of least resistance but was the absolute worst thing for my MH & wellbeing. \n\nNone of my friends at Cam would think this was the case - I seem entirely self sufficient and financially could walk away from the situation, but have found it really hard to extract myself emotionally. I'm too embarrassed and frustrated with myself to be honest with anyone about it. \n\nI have had the worst year of my life. The only light at the end of the tunnel has been returning to Cam to escape from it all, but I'm running low on hope. I wish I had some advice to give you."

I have heard even day to day conversations that jokingly patronise and mock those from lower class backgrounds, though often implicitly, or those who those who have not come from traditionally privileged families. That's without addressing the intrinsic divide created by institutions such as drinking societies that benefit, generally, those who are conventionally attractive or from certain backgrounds. I know it all sounds so obvious, but I am sick of certain groups of students at this university portraying that they are better than others who either are not as privileged as they are and so can't keep up with their 'private school-esque banter', or not so ostentatious so that they are perceived by them as irrelevant. To make it completely clear, being a member of a drinking society or a certain kind of social group at this university makes you absolutely no better than any other person here- just because you fall into a part of the social system at this university that lifts you up just because you (often, though not always) happen to come from a certain background that gives you 'good enough chat' that you're considered acceptable, that is by no means any achievement. There are some incredibly impressive, lovely people at this university that slip through the cracks and are mocked by other groups simply because they don't fit their exact mould of acceptability. And it's far from an exaggeration- I have heard so many conversations that put down such people and where those involved lift each other up out of nothing other than wanting a reason to feel superior but due to no real work or achievement of their own- only the type of school they went to or culture they happen to have been exposed to. To be clear, I don't mean in terms of academics and do truly believe everyone here academically deserves to be so from what I have seen, but what I refer to is rather the culture of elitism among some."

Whilst the president of the society welcomed everyone by saying that it was a society designed for people 'from the francophone world and lovers of it', they proceeded to give a history professor the space to celebrate the 1763 Treaty of Paris that was designed to divide up colonial territories between England and France. The professor said casually that 'anyone who is sensitive should leave the room now' and proceeded to describe the nature of the treaty before moving swiftly on to toast 'to peace' between the two nations. A black student, visibly upset, stood up and left the room during the speech. People next to me SMIRKED at this. I cannot imagine how they must have felt in that moment and I cannot believe that despite Cambridge preaching it is inclusive, this institution continues to provide spaces for people to bring up and CELEBRATE painful, violent histories in a totally inappropriate setting and manner. A lot of people were visibly uncomfortable and we had to pay \u00a350 for the privilege. My only regret (apart from going to this dinner in the first place) is that I did not stand up and leave the room with the student in solidarity. Shame on all of us that didn't have the guts to stand up and walk out."

      "None": "A periodic help post on writing statements for job applications \u2013 my personal system which has netted three interviews and two longlists in the last three weeks. NB this is entirely a personal experience, one that works for me. Results are often not instant, and you'll likely go through several applications before finding your own personal approach and voice.\n\nOne thing to note is that the job market is variable. External events dictate recruitment. I have seen a slowdown, repeated by contacts I have in the job agencies, which is a combination of the budget-setting process within companies and organisations, as well as a collective holding of breath due to the election and knock-on effects.\nAll experience is useful, what you may consider as a trifling activity can be turned into a demonstration of your planning and critical thinking. Look at your hobbies and sports. Even if you are a solo hobbyist or sportsperson, your preparations, research and planning will be a source of evidence. When I was in the Reserves, I saw a colleague present on the making of a perfect jam sandwich as part of the promotion board. He discussed equipment (plate, knife), ingredient quality (fresh bread, which jams are good), appropriate quantities (resource management) and ratio of bread, jam and butter, as well as storage solutions (fridge, Tupperware, etc.). \n\n\u2022 DO read the personal specs. My partner and I have both sifted job applicants and we have both seen copy and paste applications, including irrelevant waffle, response to non-existent specs (clearly from another job) the name of a different company in the application. If you are not that bothered about the details, we're not that bothered about you. \n\nFor a longlist, we will be skim-reading your application for key words and will likely have our own tick list. There will be a few stellar applications, some borderline maybes, mostly average applications, and some stinkers. For a shortlisting, a common practice is to score a candidate against each person spec with a 0, 1 or 2. 0 = no evidence, 1 = some evidence or tangential evidence, 2 = a spot-on evidenced response to that criterion. The applications are ranked accordingly, and the borderline candidates discussed. Usually, two or more people are involved to minimise bias and subjectivity, but not always.  Some companies will use AI and word counters. Personally, I prefer eyeballing it to catch any useful context.\n\n\u2022 DO answer each spec with some evidence. For example, nearly all specs call for an experienced user of Microsoft Office. I once led a team-level upgrade to Office 365 so I mention that. If you haven't got a work-related example, consider when you have used Office programmes, e.g. for writing and presentation, data manipulation and storage. I do add other programmes such as Google Suite and some bespoke software that I use. It is also worth mentioning any programming skills (IMHO) briefly if they are not asked for. \n\n\u2022 DO use similar language to the person spec. You will soon get a feel for which personal specs have been thought out and which ones are generic waffle. Generic specs are not an excuse for a generic answer. Your evidencing becomes even more vital at this stage. \n\n\u2022 Personally, I write out each statement from scratch, but I have saved previous statements as they provide a useful turn of phrase to reference. This pushes me to consider the context in the current application without blindly trusting past-me to have crafted a perfect sentence. Regard them as inspiration, not a cut and paste option.\n\n\u2022 Save your personal statements with a clear naming system. Also save a download or screenshot of the job vacancy, further particulars, etc. It is difficult to recall the nuances of the job spec once that advert disappears form the internet. \n\n\u2022 Read the employer's website, search for their value statements. Reflect those values in your statement in a way that it is natural that you too share those values through how you present your examples. This is appropriate for those Person Specs that are personal \u2013 e.g. flexible, positive, team-player, etc.\n\n\u2022 Once you have a bare-bone statement based on the person spec, re-read the job spec and expectations of the role. Doing this after writing your statement, you will be more alert to the language they are using to describe the job. You can edit your statement accordingly, as ell as spot any regular tasks not included in the person spec that you can acknowledge in your statement. For example, one of my recent applications had event management in the job description but not the person spec. Instead of writing out additional responses to a perceived spec, I ensured that one of my evidence responses drew from my event management experience. This is also an opportunity to nuance your language to that of the job spec. \n\n\u2022 DO maintain a bank of answers you have used the STAR method for. Two paragraphs is about what you should aim for as a crib for interviews, with a one-two sentence summary for the statement.\n(S)ituation \u2013 a succinct explanation of the background to your example. Who you were working with. What was the objective and the challenge. Where and When this was. Why were you doing this. \n(T)ask. This is where you explain what YOU were asked or decided to do. Avoid the trap of talking about the team. The employer wants to see the value you added.\n(A)ction. How did you carry out your task? What did you consider beforehand? \n(R)esult. How did your contribution affect the result? Success can be both productive (you ensured the catering for an event went smoothly) as well as preventative (You stopped an event becoming a disaster).\n\n\u2022 Maintain a healthy approach to time management for applying for jobs. Treat it as a job in of itself. Otherwise you will find things become wearisome and depressing. Keep up your meal times, rest, hobbies and exercise. Do not leave applications to the last minute, many roles in the private sector in particular state that they will close early if they receive a certain volume. \n\n\u2022 DO get coaching help, from the Careers Service, relatives, and online. There are CV services that will provide a basic report with the hope you will pay for the professional version. I have found them useful at the expense of some spam advertising of their paid services. TopCV and Belbin come to mind. Keep an eye out for free advice surgeries at careers fairs. There are regular quarterly fairs in Cambridge independent of the University. Team up with a few friends and discuss your experiences as you are applying, read each other's application statements and the job specs to see if there's something a fresh pair of eyes can spot. Champion each other and cheer each other on to success.\n\n\u2022 DO NOT despair at the knockbacks. You probably are a great fit for the role you have applied for, but you are up against dozens to hundreds of candidates at the sift stage. Your application is primarily to get through the sift process and it will come down to nuances of other candidates having that bit more of an edge, that bit more of a turn of phrase. At some point you will be that candidate."

If you're voting in Cambridge, Labour will win whether you vote Green or Labour, so you may as well vote Green.\n2. Tactical voting is only a thing because of our voting system, and Labour oppose changing the voting system, so voting 'tactically' for Labour gives them a mandate to keep things as they are.\n3. All Opposition parties actually get some funding depending on how many votes they get across the country, so e.g. every vote for the Greens funds staffing and research costs for the Green MPs that do get elected. Read more here: https://www.bbc.co.uk/.../uk-scotland-scotland-politics...\n4. Higher vote share = greater media coverage.\n5. More 2nd places for Greens this time means more viable seats to contest seriously at the next General Election, especially as Labour will be in government and so far fewer people will feel the need to vote tactically.\n6. If you're looking at tactical voting sites, just be cautious that many of them use very lazy methodologies and/or recommend voting tactically even in very safe seats where it is not necessary nor helpful.",

I've never had one large friend group where everyone is friends with each other, i've always had a few friends that don't really know each other so i've always done things with separate friends individually, which is not a problem. But sometimes, especially with people getting sprayed and congratulated after exams, i feel like i should have a friend \"group\" by now? Like I don't even know if any of my friends are going to come and congratulate me when i finish my exams because none of them talk to each other? Also on this, i feel like all of my friends have their own friend groups separate from me who they will live with or something so I'm never in the loop with their plans or anything that they're doing because it's when they're with their \"main\" friends. I just feel like i can never truly be great friends with someone unless I'm in their friendship group and icl it sucks. I don't really know what i'm asking for or if i even want to do anything, I just needed somewhere to vent."

This time, it has been over an year (his record so far was nearly 4 months) and to be fair I am pissed. So far I have excused him (my mistake) because his coming back to my life has always been in moments when I've needed reassurance the most and I always preferred a helping hand/shoulder to cry on/person to laugh with than being mad. I love this person and the need to carry for him like no one else. Obivously, the right solution is drawing the line, be it cutting ties with him once and for all or expressing my anger with him when he decides it's time to contact me again. I don't want to loose him, but probs loosing him is healthier for me? What's your take on this? Oh and yes, we had a failed romance a few years ago, that for me has eroded all the romantic feelings, but none of my loyalty. Ps sorry for all the punctuation mistakes, cba xx"

I don't mean men in their late 20s, rather men in their late 30s and early 40s. I realise their intentions for dating me were far from honourable but honestly I enjoyed it so much. I never had to worry about planning a date, they were very chivalrous and treated me with lots of respect, not to mention they paid for luxurious meals, shopping and activities. I don't necessarily need to be paid for but it was such a nice gesture and made me feel taken care of. \n\nWell anyway, I stopped this habit after finding out a guy I was seeing was married and hadn't told me. My friends were thrilled to say the least. But it is so frustrating dating men my own age and feels like a waste of my time.\n\nI've tried dating in my age range and have to say the past couple of dates I had were a disaster. Firstly, I absolutely HATE when a guy asks for your Snapchat, that app should have been left behind in middle school but for some reason adults still think it's ok to use it. And the 3 am \"wyd\" texts really put the nail in the coffin. Then there's planning the dates, which so many guys our age can't seem to do. So I always have to come up with a plan which I then have to double text the guy to confirm with. Finally the type of conversations I have with younger guys have just been so shallow. The one that stands out to me is when I went on a date and a guy asked me out of the blue whether I was \"dominant or submissive\" because he couldn't hold a conversation regarding anything else. Actually gross. \n\nJust to clarify, before anyone gets offended, I'm not suggesting all guys in their teens/early twenties are like this, but it's a pattern I've noticed. My solution has been to step out of the dating world entirely, because it just seems like a massive waste of my time. Anyway, that's my rant. Best of luck to everyone with their exams (which I should've been focusing on instead of writing this)"

Meanwhile as an international student (not the rich kind, the scholarship from a developing country kind) we have no such an option - if we don't have anything lined up we have to leave this country and getting back here on a working visa would be 100 times harder, not to mention not working for several months means no roof over my head and food in my mouth.

Work at another May Ball, at your college, or over the holidays if you need this small extra amount of cash.\n\n2: Shein are a hideous company that use what is essentially slave labour to manufacture their clothes. Look up footage of their factories. There is no excuse to use their company, just like Temu, just like Gap, just like H&M. Not sure if you're just naive but second hand clothes stores DO have a huge range of sizes. Personally, the TK Maxx in town is my haven. \n\n3: I didn't realise that a company which sells \u00a315 dresses do expert tailoring?? As someone who also needs to buy out-of-the-ordinary clothes sizes, your excuse to use Shein for this reason is inexcusable. \n\nSorry, but it felt necessary to post this. I'm sure people have their own difficult experiences of money and clothes buying, as do I (I receive the full Cambridge bursary), but personally I believe this should NEVER be an excuse to buy into companies that represent the worst of contemporary global manufacturing. \n\nEnjoy your May Ball x"

Show your support by signing the petition, which aims to make Cambridge student life more vibrant amidst the following concerning issues:\n\n1. Half of the full-time elected sabbatical officers, all from marginalized identities, have resigned from the Cambridge SU. It is unclear whether their resignations were voluntary or coerced.\n2. Remaining sabbatical officer(s) from marginalized identities is/are being prevented from attending and chairing meetings they are mandated to.\n3. The SU has not held by-elections to fill vacant positions despite repeated requests from students, including those with disabilities.\n4. A sabbatical officer, who is also a major union officer of the university, received formal warnings from Cambridge SU for raising concerns about the SU's finances before the Council Committee for Supervision of Students Union (CCSSU).\n5. A sabbatical trustee, who requested transaction report in past, has been suspended coercively. \n6. Financial transactions have been conducted in violation of the SU's own finance policy, from an annual budget of over \u00a31 million.\n\nBig questions remain: Where is the effective student representation, and why are the Cambridge SU and the university not keen to fill the vacant positions? More importantly, where is the money provided by the collegiate university to the Cambridge SU embezzled?"

It also means avoiding ambiguous phrases such as 'from the river to the sea' which - even if not the intent - can read to many Jews as if they're not welcome. Particularly importantly it means not labelling Senate House with the name of someone, Refaat, who described the Hamas attacks as \"legitimate and moral\" and joked (and I can't believe I'm typing this) about a baby being killed \"with or without baking powder\" - no matter how well-respected his poetry may be, nor how unjust his killing (like any) was.\n\nCambridge's Jews and Israelis, like its Muslims and Palestinians, are deeply traumatised by the horrific events since October 7th, on top of all the violence that came before, and the accompanying surge in antisemitism and Islamophobia, and desperately want an end to the violence. That means the university ending its complicity in destruction, as the encampment demands. To build the broad base we need to end Israel's brutal occupation of Gaza and the West Bank, and win a free Palestine alongside a free Israel, we need everyone on board, and that must include the majority of British Jews who are understandably fearful right now. I really hope the encampment will actively build trust and demonstrate it is a safe space for all who want to see a free Palestine, and that the University of Cambridge will come to the negotiating table and accept the demands."

I understand the majority of the course content, but I'm worried that I'm going to be marked down as I'm really struggling to memorise all of this extra stuff. I'm so incredibly jealous of my friends doing subjects such as law and HSPS who don't have to spend days and days memorising such pointless pieces of information (that is not to say I don't think their exams should be open book- I do, and I think it should be standardised across subjects).

      "None": "#Camfession40543\n\nCN: anorexia (positive!) \n. \n. \n. \n. \n. \n. \n. \n. \n. \n. \nTo anyone thinking about starting a super restrictive (or tbh any restrictive diet) for a 'summer body', or going back to your old ED because you're stressed and tired and feel like everything is falling apart and it gives you a semblance of control, this is your sign, your permission to not\u2026\n\nI hate anorexia so much - of all the things I've dealt with in my life (oxbridge finals, breakups, friendship acrimony, family drama) I'd honestly say it's the worst by quite a long shot; but you only realise how bad it it when you're in the depths of it, and climbing out again is hell. Even with Herculean levels of motivation to escape anorexia's tentacles it is hell. \nAt first it's so nice; the euphoria of the initial phases of starvation and the reward of watching bits of your body you've hated for years just melt away overnight. It's even more true if you're using it to cope with everything else going wrong; successfully going for day(s) without eating and the associated weight loss offering the escape of feeling, for the first time in months, that you've actually managed to achieve something.\n\nBut it's short lived, and the longer you go on the more unhappy you become; your starved body becomes increasingly numb to anything and everything, unable to think of anything other than food, and hating itself for thinking incessantly about the thing you've told yourself and told yourself you don't need. Your life shrinks to a small circle of when you can eat next, and how much; your day becoming consumed by trying to work out if you're close enough to collapse to justify a sandwich. You loose the ability to take joy in anything- conversation becomes exhausting, and even watching Netflix or reading a book becomes joyless as youre constantly beset by endless thoughts of food. It's inescapable. Or if you're not beset by thoughts of food, you're being tortured by the guilt of the thought of the food you've eaten, or just generally struggling to focus because of the brain fog; except you don't realise it's brain fog because of starvation because you think you're eating too much and that the reason you can't think or focus or function, or honestly even see, is because you're stupid and an imposter and so you despise yourself even more and so starve yourself even more. \n\nThe brain fog creeps up slowly - at first starvation offers mental clarity, and so you think your brain functions better without food. It's a lie- over time, slowly, as your body becomes increasingly used to being starved and so adapts to compensate, it will restrict your ability to think clearly. But walking round Cambridge, holding a conversation, trying to think, trying to see; everything feels like such a challenge, such an effort, such a task. The world shrinks and feels inexplicably dark and scary.\nFor months, the world has existed apart from me; it is as being behind a cloudy screen, where you can see everything going on, but you're unable to feel as if you're there. I feel like every social conversation I've had for months has been in some way a lie, my participation involving a calculation of the bare minimum of effort to appear to engage, while feeling like it's happening from behind a screen, or in a different realm. If you've never experienced it, it's difficult to imagine, but let me assure you, dearest, gentle reader, it is misery.\nStarvation is misery. The idea that you'll be happy when you reach x size, when you go y amount of time without eating or manage to only eat z amount of calories in a day is a delusion. It is impossible to feel happiness when you are starved. The misery is not from having to miss out on a tasty treat; it is a simple biological response to an insufficient m number of calories.\nIt is impossible to derive any joy out of anything in life when you are starved. No matter how big the win, how good the event, if you are in a state of deprivation, you will feel nothing. And there's a decent chance that due to your general inability to function as a consequence of said deprivation, you'll loose friends and partners and opportunities in the process, and so actually everything will become an order of magnitude worse. \n\nThe irony of all of this is that it is, obviously, remedied by food. The problem is that once you've reached the depths of starvation, you've lost the ability to know how much food a human needs, and every single bite is acute mental torture. This isn't your own weakness; various studies (the minesota starvation experiment is particularly interesting here) suggest that when the body becomes starved it develops a paradoxical aversion to food; perhaps because it's learned it's a scarce resource that needs to be rationed. But it is hell. You exist in one of two states; consumed by thoughts of food or plans for when you can next eat, or consumed by overwhelming and soul crushing guilt for the food you've eaten. The amount of time I've spend seeking solace in the department bathrooms this year, either to have somewhere to sit in an endeavour to not fall over before the allocated time I could eat my sandwich, or to have a panic attack after eating said sandwich because of the guilt, is, honestly, tragic. Trying to pipette with a mind either clouded by the fog of starvation or (still clouded by the fog of starvation) but simultaneously screaming at you for having eaten a sandwich is just miserable.\nThat is the reality of anorexia.\n\nI am getting better, and I will be fine. The world slowly feels like it's coming back into colour and I never, ever want to go back to the darkness of the past few months. This has been the worst year of my life because of this and I would give a lot to be able to go back in time a year, and show the girl I was what embarking on her 'short term' restrictive diet would do, I would. So this is a message to anyone who was in the position I was last year. You will not be the exception and this can and will destroy your life, far far more than buying one dress size up will,  so just don't do it. \n\nMaking healthier, natural/less processed/whole food based choices out of love and respect for your body is one thing, (if ED recovery has taught me anything it's that my body does actually appreciate being fed fruit and vegetables more than Pringles haha) but restrictive eating with the goal to eat as little as possible / general starvation will only ever end one way, and you won't know that it's led to that until it's too late.",
      "associated_text": "The brain fog creeps up slowly - at first starvation offers mental clarity, and so you think your brain functions better without food. It's a lie- over time, slowly, as your body becomes increasingly used to being starved and so adapts to compensate, it will restrict your ability to think clearly. But walking round Cambridge, holding a conversation, trying to think, trying to see; everything feels like such a challenge, such an effort, such a task. The world shrinks and feels inexplicably dark and scary."

It's not my fault for not mentioning it earlier until I had a strong case that would've been police-worthy and found people who'd back me up?? And I know other people reported him too (I think)?? And I don't really want to think about the possible impacts on his life or the justifications for his actions after everything that happened to me??

I never talk about this to anyone apart from therapists because I'm still have a good relationship with my parents and don't want to bring shame on them, but it can feel really lonely and isolating sometimes. This is specific to me, but friends have commented that I have strange eating patterns and spend a lot of time in bed when I'm stressed, and I know it all leads back to how I coped as a child but I've no way of formulating that because it's so embarrassing. The only way I can express it is this bit cloud that lingers over me, affects how I act (eg it's really hard for me to ask for help because I've always sorted myself out) I guess what I'm trying to find is a) maybe some solidarity on how hard it is, or failing that b) maybe understanding that while my situation might not be typical, that means it's okay for me to struggle sometimes compared to others. And maybe if you relate, know that I see you and understand how hard it is, but you are so brave to keep going, and you're not alone."

      "None": "Anyone else feel simultaneously terrified and yet somehow complacent about graduating with no clear career plan? \n\nLike many humanities students, I've always dreamt of a successful career in the Arts that would be financially viable to live off, as well as being deeply fulfilling. In recent years I've realized that this is very rare, with most artists, writers, musicians, actors etc having alternative primary careers for years before they become successful - if not for their whole life. I've always been good at doing what I'm told, but since leaving school I've found my motivation gradually wane as it has become clear that in the real world: 1. nobody particularly cares about you (in a neutral way, I'm not paranoid), so no one will come and punish you for slacking off or give you a gold star for going the extra mile, and 2. I have no innate drive to top tripos or get a big corporate job or make a million pounds. In the absence of external validation/pressure or internal motivation, I'm being guided haphazardly by what seems like the right thing to do - but in a world where everyone is constantly encouraged to 'be yourself' and do whatever makes you happy, that is also unclear.\n\nPart of the problem is struggling from perfectionism, which I think is common in many high-achieving teenage girls. It feels like if something is not considered extraordinary (like getting all top grades or getting into Cambridge, imo), then it's not worth pursuing. Yet because I have no desire to get some high-flying city job,, I feel like I would be just as happy at home looking after a family and a home than working a 9-5 somewhere underwhelming. The pressure to specialize and commit the 'potential' that you've been told about all your life to one real-world job is very unsettling. I'm aware this smacks of privilege - I haven't done anything to 'earn' the brains that got me here, besides working hard through school, and I know that a degree here is supposed to open doors and provide people with opportunities in careers they enjoy (something not everyone has the luxury to choose). Yet I can't help feeling that I have peaked - that I will never feel as validated as when I'm able to say I go here, something I'm really proud of. \n\nIt would be nice to know if anyone feels the same way or has any advice about getting excited to graduate and move onto the next stage of life"

It's time for students to demand that the allocation of funds from colleges to the SU once again goes through the jcr so that we can actually make meaningful demands, get some accountability and have power as students, instead of the SU being completely divorced from the realities of it's student body.

My supervisors say I ought to see someone but every time I've ever spoken about mental health or gone to therapy nothing has ever worked. Ever. Idk what to do. I hate being the problem student for my tutor and DoS as well. It's feels like everyone has such low expectations for me now. I used to want to get a first, imagine that. It sucks. Does anyone know where I can go from here because I know I do need to catch this before it gets worse (I do not want to intermit under any circumstances that would drive me to the edge lmao)."

Realllly self-absorbed but they don't always show it early on, biggest players in the game. For this reason they might be good in bed though, so that's a plus if you manage not to get attached. 6/10\n\nFinance: first off, in this you technically have two subcategories - the traditional banker/advisor bro and the more hip startup one. The first can at least rock a suit, but essentially a self-glorified mathmo with zero social sensibility; the second one cannot for the life of them adhere to a dress code but somewhat more socially apt. However, they will both talk your ears off about *their* plans, careers and achievements, good luck if you get 2-3 questions an hour (and this is coming from someone who yaps unprompted).  Really just self-absorbed. 3/10\n\nLaw: similar to the one above in some respects, with the exception that they are taught to read the room and therefore more fun to flirt with. Problem is, they will be the ones to spout really f*ckboy-like clich\u00e9s which might charm some people, but also will undoubtedly give the ick to others. Almost as much of a player group as humanities, just not quite there because (funnily enough) they seem less genuine from the get-go. Best style though. 5/10\n\nSTEM: so hear me out, this is a real hit or miss one. On the one hand you have those who seem like they are playing (they are just a bit awkward and might be anxious, but only end up inducing anxiety in both parties) but others can be quite genuine, and very fun to chat with (them going on about their interests but also listening attentively to yours). Will have to be at least somewhat interested in the arts though to make it work. For the good ones, it's an easy 8/10\n\nDisclaimer 1: Obviously this is not meant to hurt anyone and was made just for fun, also your mileage may vary.\n\nDisclaimer 2: as the sample pool is itself pre-vetted, things like physical attraction, hygiene etc are fairly standard across all groups. I just wanted to state this before you come at me with generalisations."
