Scratch that, cancel your plans.\n\nI've started watching student plays this term (best decision ever) and witnessed so much talent!\n\nIt's by far the wittiest and smartest play I've seen this term when it comes to the dialogue. Some jokes took me a while but I caught them just as they were flying over my head. The use of dramaturgy incorporated into the plot is exceptionally clever.\n\nIt's a novel concept that's well acted throughout and then the addition of a new character throws the dynamics into haywire. The titular \"It's You or Me\" emerges at the emotional climax of the play (which was just insane and had me gripped ever since the physical use of that old storytelling device rears its head [go watch to understand this!]).\n\nThen, just as you expect the show to end, there's a late in the day emergence much like Orson Welles in The Third Man, stealing the show from then on.\n\nThank you to the hard work of the writer, production, and cast for an excellent show!"

I obviously have to speak to the porter to be able to get my wheelchair in sometimes when the gate isn't fully open. I'm not a kings member so I just usually cut through during the day and one of the porters told me, after questioning me about why I was bringing external food and drink in and nodding to my cup, that he doesn't care about it being an access issue and that rules are rules. I know it was probably just a one-off with a bad porter but now I'm scared to keep cutting through in case they question me again. It was so embarrassing so now I have to add 15 minutes on my commute from my college to sidge and it's so annoying."

You walk into the hall, see something truly wondrous, and then feel that the fact it's used as an (admittedly lovely) cafeteria is just incongruous and an immense waste. The low number of formals is something a lot of students who otherwise like Kings regret slightly. I think that if kings wants to be informal that's fine but morally they should build themselves a new, informal, college somewhere else in the city and let a new college that will actually make full use of their incredible site take over. The obvious response to this is \"it's our college we can do what we want with it\" but Kings was paid for by taxes levied on the entire nation, and is part of our national artistic heritage, turning it into a cafeteria doesn't really work."

It also has one of the best access programmes (the two are likely connected!). Take a look at the state school numbers at John\u2019s and Peterhouse and then get back to me. Honestly, this is such a lazy take. There\u2019s nothing wrong with being from a state school and enjoying gowns and Latin graces, but it has nothing to do with why King\u2019s is non-traditional - it has a reputation for radical political activity that goes back to the 70s. It was also the first college (along with Churchill and Clare) to admit women (in 1972). Generations and generations of students later,  I think many of us at King\u2019s are still proud of our college history, and endeavour to carry on in that spirit. King\u2019s definitely has its issues as a college, but I think it\u2019s not right to ignore that history - it\u2019s more complicated than just not wearing gowns to be different."

Idk why our college does this because the traditional cambridge experience is so fun on its own, and our dining hall is indisputably one of the best in all of Cambridge, and yet for some reason (I think the student body largely) the college feels like it's punching below its weight sometimes in what it could be giving in the way of a traditional cambridge experience. i wouldn't change my college for the world, the reputation of kings, its music, its academics and its architecture are all a massive ego boost for a start. but idk, I feel like it could also really milk the cambridge experience more (maybe the reason it doesn't do so is because unlike other colleges it has nothing to prove - ours is the most famous college here, after all)."

I immediately apologised \u2013 it was an honest mistake (I wasn\u2019t trying to be sneaky or anything). But he was so rude about it and made us walk the long way back, around the college\u2019s back and then along the chapel (although we were literally next to the college\u2019s entrance, ready to leave). What doesn\u2019t sit well with me was the way he spoke to us \u2013 I kept apologising (and meant it), but all he could say was, \u201cThe sign\u2019s pretty big\u201d. It was quite humiliating to be told off like that in front of my parents, and it was also something I did not need at all before leaving Cambridge for good.

I know for a fact that during the day, tourists wandering behind the allowed area signs have ended up in students kitchens, or even bedrooms. I am aware and sympathetic that being able to walk through would potentially make a safer environment for people walking home at night, but hopefully you can also understand that in the first instance, a college\u2019s priority will always be its own students?"

The chapel costs just under \u00a320 million a year to keep heated. This is done through floor heating but is dated and inefficient. They can make at least \u00a310 million a year through tourists, which subsidies the heating of the chapel. They want to replace the underfloor heating and fix the shit lead roof, but this will be very time-consuming, so have not pulled the trigger. When they do, the chapel will be out of use for a while. They are also talking about solar panels at the top. I'm not JUSTIFYING just recalling what I've been told! Fun fact: You can get a tour round the top of the chapel as a King's student. You can take non-king students just ask the Domus Bursar."

Kings lets in so many tourists, so any arguments about a \"warm, insulated-from-the wider-world quality\" that you're being forced to surrender aren't really relevant - the college has already willingly surrendered this for money, why not extend it to other colleges' students as well at this point 2. Kings is far harder to get into than Trinity or Johns, where 4 times out of 5 you can just walk straight in through the plodge (** there's definitely white privilege here, but that's a whole other issue **). Kings you have to justify your presence, show your camcard and jump through all these arbitrary hoops. It is a problem with all the river colleges to varying degrees, but Kings is by far one of the least accessible. 3. Kings' location makes it way more desirable to cut through - the nearest public bridges are both 5+ minutes walk away, so if you're trying to get back to Caius accommodation/Robinsons/Clare Hall/Selwyn/Newnham etc at night, it's a lot quicker and safer to go through Kings 4. That said, it's not just an issue with Kings - other colleges need to be less gatekeepy as well"

If we're going to let everyone through (which I'm not even opposed to in principle), get the other stuffy colleges to do so too, because it's not fair that other colleges get to preserve that warm, insulated-from-the-wider-world quality and we should have to surrender it."

They literally RUN to close and lock the door at 9 to prevent any latecomers from having their meal, but they are tortoise-slow to serve meals.

Still doesn't diminish the one-upmanship in this letter being straight up embarrassing though. Slip a handwritten post-it note through saying you have heard that fireworks will be used at that time on that night. Mans used the college coat of arms this is why no one likes Cambridge students."

It was hard to remember the themes in some of the smaller areas because there was fairly sparce deco. The lights however made the area pretty and the acts on main stage were great!

One of them was tethered directly in the bright sun, which was so blazing this afternoon that I had to look for shade after 30 minutes in it started to make me feel faint. I can't imagine how that would affect the sensitive eyes of a creature adapted to live in the darkness. The owls were also all surrounded by students, who did their best to be respectful as far as I saw but did get quite close to get photos sometimes and were naturally having fun (as they should be!) so were sometimes a bit tipsy and having loud conversations, not to mention the noise from the main band across the garden. One of the birds looked visibly distressed at points, but the keeper was busy with a queue of students waiting to take photos with the owls on their arms and didn't check on the tethered birds once that I could see in the 30 minutes I was there. I don't think it's anyone's fault who attended the event, who wouldn't have intended any harm, but owls are nocturnal creatures that prefer quiet environments and a loud, sunny, garden party seems like it would naturally make them stressed and unhappy."

It's meant to be a chant!\" First lad: fuck-you-new-nham! Others: Fuck you Newnham! First lad: fuck-you-new-nham! Others: Fuck you Newnham! *and so on, riding off into the distance* They thought nobody saw them. They thought nobody cared. But I did. And as the petty person I am, I'm writing a whole camfess about it. From those few seconds, I have no way of knowing what might have provoked such a bizarre event. But let's just say that at first, I kinda assumed that the existence of all-female colleges at Cambridge was mostly some sort of quirk/relic of history, though of course some people might prefer a single-sex college for personal or religious reasons. (all the old prestigious schools in my home country are single sex as well because they were founded way back when). After this, I realise that this is the sort of thing that explains why places like Newnham still need to exist. Smh."

(This is why it is entirely painted blue, because Thatcher believed that the colour of the Conservative Party was much better and minimising the effects of nuclear weapons.) however, once Diane Abbott (newnham alumn) became the first black female MP with Labour, the college became embarrassed about their tory past and made the room into storage space to hide its Thatcherite origins. That is the REAL reason that it isn\u2019t used."

A proper bar and bop space was promised when they knocked down the old building, but one of the staff members at the time who was in charge of food and drink was opposed to alcohol on religious grounds and so instead of the Iris space being a combined cafe/bar like in other colleges any bar or alcohol related materials had to be kept in the locked cupboard it's currently in, and whereas the cafe was run by catering staff the bar was run by student \"volunteers\" who were initially paid in \u00a35 vouchers. When they opened the new conference centre they stuck \"Party Room\" on a basement storage room and painted the walls, floor and ceiling bright blue so that they could claim they'd kept their promise. I went to a JCR event there in my first year which was pretty crap as the space isn't designed to be used as a party room. It's really small, you can't have glasses as the floor is concrete and anything dropped smashes, and the combination of no windows and entirely blue surfaces made you feel like you were floating in some kind of sweaty smurf hell."

It was only ever meant to be used as international student storage in the break but now it\u2019s full of random crap. There\u2019s effectively no basement space in any of the buildings and so it\u2019s one of the only places anything can be left - that isn\u2019t already filled to the brim.

In an official statement, Christ\u2019s has firmly denied any and all accusations of misconduct and will reportedly rely on the legal services of Stephen Toope himself should the matter proceed any further\u2026."

Obviously it\u2019s wonderful to celebrate when people achieve highly, but in a college where around half of students achieve firsts things like scholars\u2019 dinner start to feel more about who\u2019s excluded than who\u2019s included. It would be very easy for the college to give out a small reward - eg an ornament or a book voucher - without making such a huge deal about it. There are so many scholars, and so many things in which scholars are included, that it can start to feel like there are two tiers of student, and more like you\u2019re being punished for not getting a first than like others are being celebrated for getting one."

I just finished my first year at Christ\u2019s and I\u2019m appalled by how intense and unhealthy the environment is here and more than anything how DoS and supervisors feed and facilitate this pressure. The other students here are great people, but it\u2019s clear that the precedent set by our supervisors and DoS makes students here very competitive (not in an intentionally malicious way but people certainly compare hours spent studying every day, their results and rank much more than my friends from other colleges). I\u2019m dreading the beginning of next year because I know that everyone will know who didn\u2019t get a first after the scholar\u2019s dinner and I\u2019m embarrassed that I didn\u2019t get one (even though a 2.i is still a great result that I would have been proud of if the standard wasn\u2019t that everything else than a first is subpar). Things like having designated scholar\u2019s rooms, only scholars getting to say grace at formals and the scholar\u2019s ceremony/dinner all create a very public and obvious divide between being \u201cgood enough\u201d and \u201cnot deserving\u201d and it\u2019s hard to be on the latter side of that line when your worth and results have been so closely tied by college. I love my friends here but being at Christ\u2019s is really taking its toll on my mental health and I wish the college would consider revoking some of these practices."

      "text": "Why is St John\u2019s Voices really being shut down? It is a very successful choir and provides opportunities for female singers of all vocal types, while the main college choir does not include sopranos, limiting opportunities for women. Indeed, there is currently only one female singer in St John\u2019s College Choir. The statement put out by John\u2019s regarding music in the college (https://www.joh.cam.ac.uk/music-college-st-johns-statement) implies SJV is sucking up resources which could instead be used for more accessible music opportunities including \u2018masterclasses in music, for example on song writing\u2019 and supporting \u2018new opportunities for non-auditioned singing\u2019. The implication seems to be that SJV is somehow elitist. Additionally, the statement claims \u2018Students\u2019 preferences and experiences in music today are different from those of previous generations, and many of them have had fewer musical opportunities in school than might have been the case in the past.\u2019 This implies SJV essentially is being scrapped because state schools are failing to provide music opportunities and training to pupils. This is pretty sad and illogical if true. Additionally, the college stresses in the statement the \u2018significant resources currently devoted to St John\u2019s Voices\u2019, but I wonder how much the choir really costs to run. The whole move to scrap SJV seems rather underhanded and I don\u2019t see why a high-level choir like SJV cannot coexist with more accessible music opportunities, especially in a college as rich as St John\u2019s. By the way, I am not a member of SJV, I am just confused about why the choir apparently needs to be scrapped. Here is a link to the petition to save SJV: https://www.change.org/p/save-st-john-s-voices-stop-cutting-opportunities-for-female-singers-in-cambridge"

      "text": "TLDR: John's ball committee and the musicians are both handling things terribly. As a musician who has played at every major may ball (including John's) in my years here, I wonder whether people fully appreciate how absurd the situation with John's is. The deposit system was ridiculous: I understand that it is standard for events, but it is stupid to treat student bands like professional ones. We are not paid anything near what a professional band would be, so expecting us (broke students) to be able to cough up deposit money like real adults could, especially when most of us don't see much or any profit from playing, is not at all feasible. I think this was a case of John's being so desperate to make the ball as \"professional\" as possible that they neglected the realities of working within a student context. That said, I think that the musicians' response has been incredibly childish too. There was some good work done early on with helping musicians communicate with each other about the deposit and how to combat the practice, but since then the group has devolved into name-calling and heel-dragging. Instead of focusing on how to help musicians like at the start, since all the boycott announcements the focus has moved into the completely unproductive front of trying to slander John's on social media. Entire days were spent whining about John's removing tags on Instagram instead of actually working towards anything (and, as #Camfession36094 noted, having the gall to compare this minor problem with the fucking Chinese government) and the one person who actually managed to forge a genuinely insightful dialogue with some of the John's committee members did so on his own, only for the musicians to start quibbling with him on the chat rather than, for example, taking what he's said into account and writing a new letter to John's. This isn't my fight; I'm not playing this year and have been focusing on my thesis over playing music all year, but the idiotic and childish way this has been conducted on both sides annoys the hell out of me."

Now, I\u2019m just extremely annoyed and honestly eaten up with more stress that I simply didn\u2019t need during exam season. For those who don\u2019t know, Johns\u2019 has decided to charge deposits for all of their student performers. This was initially at a whopping \u00a3260 per individual in the band and also only targeted to smaller, newer bands. After an obvious outcry from student performers about the ridiculousness and frank unfairness of this, they quickly backtracked and said they would reduce this to \u00a350 per person for all groups. This is still way more than what I\u2019m getting paid for my performance as a whole. I\u2019m honestly kind of dumbfounded. As a student with loans on my head, I\u2019m now expected to be paying the May Ball ahead of my performance for the glory of being able to be there. Their justification for this is that big festivals like Latitude and so on have this system so that their bands actually turn up or so that bands don\u2019t gatecrash the event afterwards. Please can I point out that no other Cambridge May Ball does this? Why does Johns\u2019 think it is so much better than everyone else that it needs to enforce such a system on students? Rather than looking forward to the event I\u2019m now just stressed. I want to make sure I can turn up, play my piece and disappear quickly so that they have no excuses to claim my money. God forbid I get ill on the day - I\u2019ll have to hope that they don\u2019t use my illness and inability to perform to leave me significantly poorer than before. If you\u2019re feeling just as angry after reading this, then please do interact with this post - we need all the support we can get in order to put more pressure on them to abolish the deposit system :/"

During the second grace at hall, all the (pissdrunk) students engaged in their regular game of \u201chow much can I make my chair squeak\u201d, an innocent and time-honoured tradition. But the head caterer (?) was clearly in a bad mood because he snarled \u201cwell I\u2019m not going to start until you stop playing with your chairs\u201d. Of course this made us giddy, but we stopped anyway, in desperation for our desserts. But predictably, as soon as the first Latin syllable was uttered, there went the chairs again! So our old friend stopped the reading: \u201cI\u2019m going to stop there and we can all stand in silence for two minutes\u201d. Let me tell you, I was fighting for my LIFE trying not to explode in laughter, and I\u2019m certain everyone else in the room felt the same, grinning like idiots at the surreal situation of us all being disciplined like schoolboys. Even the fellows looked a bit pissed off that they were being made to wait - I mean they have busy lives to get on with! Clearly the grouchy caterer realised his mistake and resumed the grace after about 40 seconds (poor show - at least commit to it). And of course, when the reading was finished, everyone sat down and exploded into laughter. Brilliant. (Hope the guy\u2019s okay tho cuz he got done dirty by the entire hall)"

Having paid over \u00a3100 to attend a May Ball this year, I\u2019ll be really disappointed if it turns out the food isn\u2019t going to be what I expected (and, quite frankly, what I paid for). Yes, vegan food can also be good, but the options are by definition less varied than for non-vegan options. I also think that in general this desire to make everything vegan has gone too far. People\u2019s diet is a personal decision and people shouldn\u2019t be patronised by having their dietary choices made for them, especially when the majority of the student body is still meat eating. On top of that, as has already been pointed out, serving only vegan options excludes people with certain dietary requirements. Darwin\u2019s May Ball committee have said that they will \u201ccater to as many dietary requirements as possible\u201d, but what will they say to people who have been told by doctors they are medically unable to go vegan, as well as the circumstances already mentioned in previous Camfesses? Try as you might, only serving vegan food is always going to be less inclusive than serving a variety of foods, because the variety of base options is lower. Bearing in mind that the food served at a May Ball can only ever be a drop in the environmental pond, May Balls should focus on other options for cutting or offsetting their carbon footprint which will not result in the exclusion of some students in the process. Also, quite frankly, I\u2019ll be pretty frustrated if I only find out after having paid for a May Ball that the food isn\u2019t going to be anything like what I\u2019d expected."

The truth is that Downing lawyers are normal people; when I\u2019m not stuck into the 3 essays I write per day, 4 moots per week, advising members of the royal family, regular 1-on-1 candlelit dinners I attend with Supreme Court judges or reading through fan mail from law firm partners I\u2019m actually a regular student, just like you. The camfess in question smacks of jealousy, and in reading that submission I couldn\u2019t help but catch the scent of someone pooled from Downing to an outlier college. To them I would say, Cambridge is Cambridge, soft rejection is redirection and I\u2019m sorry you couldn\u2019t be as clever as me \u2764\ufe0f"

      "text": "Alright sorry to be the guy but Fitz being heralded as this beacon of the LGBT inclusivity because of the Christian Concern lawsuit is chat and it\u2019s time to explain why. For those who don\u2019t know, Fitzwilliam College is being sued by Christian Concern because the latter tried to hold a conference at Fitz and Fitz said no. Christian Concern have decided that Fitz did so due to political disagreement with Christian Concern\u2019s values, and are suing them for infringing their right to free speech or some shit. Most people have taken Christian Concern\u2019s reasoning and used it to shower Fitz in praise and medals, but that\u2019s not why Fitz rejected them. We don\u2019t know for sure why Fitz said no to Christian Concern\u2019s desired dates, but as graduation later fell on those dates it\u2019s likely those plans were being finalised when Christian Concern got in touch for the conference, and Fitz wanted to keep the dates free. We know that Fitz were otherwise happy to host Christian Concern, as Fitz OFFERED OTHER DATES to Christian Concern. Fitz never rejected them in the first place; they just rejected those dates. Christian Concern is just suing them because that\u2019s the primary thing they do \u2014 attack Muslims and queer people, and fund the legal costs of affiliated Christians who are in court for doing the same in order to stay in the headlines. Fitz isn\u2019t a good place to be LGBT. There are some absolutely lovely Christians at Fitz, who love everybody and demand a lot of respect. These Christians disassociate with the Fitz Christian Soc, because that Soc has been publicly homo, trans, bi, and islamophobic for I don\u2019t even know how long, but I was warned about it by my college parents upon arrival and it\u2019s still true now. This presence has been told to college and no action has been taken. Instead, when reported to the porters by one of this group, college porters force queer students to take down their pride flags, while permitting other types of flags to be proudly displayed. Frankly, this is likely why Christian Concern chose Fitz for their conference, as most colleges don\u2019t have a Christian Soc with both the values and longevity of Fitz\u2019. For balance, the Fitz Chaplain is wonderful and open to everybody, and the college bar is legitimately a queer safe space. If any attacks happened in the bar, it would be taken seriously. And part of the issues around being queer at Fitz are with particular problem queers within the student body who make queer socials at the college inaccessible, it\u2019s not all to do with the Christian Soc, as harmful as that group of Christians is. Anyway the reason why I\u2019m writing this is just to get the facts out there. The Christian Concern thing has been brought up multiple times to me since I got here, from people who saw the original misinformation post on Camfess about how great Fitz is for standing its ground (which never happened). So hopefully the people who read that post will read this one and realise it\u2019s just Christian Concern outright making things up \u2014 which is Fitz\u2019 legal defence, if you look into it. Fitz doesn\u2019t think twice about queer rights, but this case has made them paranoid about criticism from Christians, and all of their statements are written to Christians if you read them carefully. That really says it all. P.S. I am queer and I\u2019m not Muslim so I\u2019ve tried not to talk on behalf of Muslims here, but the way Muslims have been completely ignored by people following this story is sad and shows how much work needs to be done in that area. Christian Concern grew its platform because it was the main anti-Muslim Christian group \u2014 so many others out there were anti-queer it was practically mainstream \u2014 and yet when Christian Concern does something like this everyone only thinks about the queer community. That ain\u2019t right."

I get other colleges are raising rent prices but that is taking the attention away from a college charging incoming freshers and existing undergraduates within the 13-16k range for rent. This is a college which boasts its state school stats. This is a college that does not have the historic funding Johns and Catz do, these colleges can access the funds somehow but are possibly reluctant. Lucy Cavendish is a college that has no long term plan, no back up plan and no funding to ease the situation and yet keeps growing in size. It provides no bursaries and inadequate financial support and funding. The attention and pressure needs to remain on Lucy Cav, help us please."

Fine it might not have a big budget but you still get a Cambridge education just perhaps without the elitism of other bigger colleges. It has been said before and I\u2019ll say it again, the major difference between Lucy Cav and other colleges is it\u2019s diverse student body.

The senior tutor at Lucy cavendish is treating this living animal like a bloody toy for students and has shoved responsibility to the vets with no warning, literally told them to sort out care for the next morning or else the Guinea pig wouldn\u2019t be fed. This behaviour disgusts me and I feel so bad for the vets stressing about their workload but now trying to work out how to balance caring for this Guinea pig on top of their studies because they\u2019ve been told it\u2019s them or no one.

The amount of support I've received from this college, particularly in times of difficulty and particularly where other, bigger colleges may be unreachable e.g. over the summer vac is truly amazing. Words cannot express how loved and supported I've felt at this college. The college community is also so wonderful, you don't have to be the closest friends with everyone to just sit there and have a chat. Also, you have to understand the College only recently (roughly 2 years ago) became a mixed and 18+ college, they are trying their best to build up to the same standard as other colleges who have had decades to do so - truly comparisons cannot be drawn until Lucy Cav is given more time.  I'm sure a lot of Lucy Cav students don't hate the college as much as the select few spreading their hateful, unexplained views. Everyone has qualms about their college.

It\u2019s understandable that people feel the system had been taken advantage of, and that it is unfair so many desirable rooms have been taken, but I think some lines have been crossed. As someone with a diagnosed disability that affects my day-to-day life, I was relieved to get an exemption this year - regardless of whether I could live with a friend. I\u2019ve heard people complain that, because there are less rooms available, their large friend groups will be split up. I was entirely willing to not live with my friends if it meant my access needs were met so as I could live with less pain and exhaustion. But I now feel incredible guilt whenever I hear people talking about the room ballot. People have asked me if I have a \u201creal disability\u201d, or if I\u2019m \u201cactually disabled though\u201d, or not to \u201crub it in\u201d. Without question, I would gladly swap my new build room for a normal 20-year-old body in an instant. I would give so much more than the cost of new build rent to have a normal student experience instead of feeling stuck in the body of an 80-year-old. Please remember that. I already had to prove to the University DRC that I am medically disabled, which the college then have to evaluate, too, so, while I appreciate your frustration, I really don\u2019t need the judgement."

The 1988 Club is not a drinking society, nor is it defunct. There are now both male and female drinking societies at Magdalene, although the article failed to mention how the reason they are secret is because they were formally banned for getting matching swastika tattoos all too recently. All their secretism allows them to do is be more selective with who they allow to participate. My female friends at Magdalene have told me many stories and I think to claim that the boat club is the main source of friction is to undercut the masses of sexism from both staff and students."

It\u2019s such a cheap and unscrupulous move that puts them on the same level as the very worst of this country\u2019s media. If you want people to take your organisation even a little bit seriously, don\u2019t produce almost identical content to the Daily Mail. The headlines and framing of the articles are misleading and it\u2019s glaringly obvious to anyone with any common sense. Of course the theme couldn\u2019t be changed the day before an event where hundreds of thousands of pounds were spent to cater to an incredibly specific theme. Of course there was no malice or even intention behind the deeply ironic coincidence, because it was just that: a coincidence. It is so disappointing to see student journalism at this uni of such low quality, and which so obviously prioritises engagement over truth or accurate representation. I know it\u2019s just student journalism, but there should at least be some moral standards behind their journalistic choices, and right now I\u2019m embarrassed to have this kind of reporting associated with my university."

Any reasonably-minded person accepts literally nothing could have been done given the circumstances and allowing the national press to vilify the committee in the way that they have is just plain disgusting. Short of cancelling the May Ball outright there and then (which no-one in the college would have supported), they did the only decent, possible thing they could have done- express regret. I honestly don\u2019t know why some individuals have sought to promote this story and take it out of context (including asking the family for comment), but all I can say is they probably ought to consider their social responsibility."

The same day I got my offer from the college my friend began saying stuff like: 'Ah damn you should have applied to a city centre college like Kings or Trinity and put Selwyn as your second choice' 'Selwyn is a bit dead compared to the bigger colleges' 'Selwyn not that good' So I went home that day and started googling Selwyn and getting annoyed that I didn't pick the 'right college'. Was pretty annoyed and even started reading about the other colleges I 'should have' applied to. That night I had a dream that I went on a spiritual and lifelong mission to find why Selwyn was the right college for me. The dream involved car chases, having to get past aggressors stopping me getting on flights as part of my 'journey to find the meaning of Selwyn', me climbing mountains and even going on different train journeys across the world on a conquest to discover why Selwyn is the greatest college. I failed my mission and did not find the Selwyn meaning of life. I went home disappointed (still in my dream). Things changed however, when I went into my office and sadly reached for my birth certificate. I had given up all hope. But my birth certificate no longer said 'Simon Pattison' It said 'Selwyn Pattison'"

Jesus Green, revs/spoons, market square, grafton, mash, Magdalene bridge, gardies, MAINSBURYS!!? On average, Sidney is definitely closest to and in the middle of each and every one of these.

The cursed events that followed have deeply disturbed those of us who have since heard of them. As the evening progressed and the rowers presumably got increasingly drunk, a game of \u2018gay chicken\u2019 began. This culminated in what a previous Camfess termed a \u201cTrinity bisexual poop orgy\u201d. \u2018Where does \u201cpoop\u201d enter the matter?\u2019 you may ask. Well. As their game progressed, the rowers proceeded to wank each other off on the roof of Neville\u2019s Court (right above where the library skylights are, as I understand it). While it may be disagreeable behaviour, this does in all fairness constitute a good performance at gay chicken. Poo then enters the story when the rowers re-entered the staircase. Not content with public masturbation atop a historic 17th century building, one rower then decided (through some utterly incomprehensible thought process) to commit an unthinkable and morally criminal act. He took a shit on somebody\u2019s windowsill. After the occupant of the room then discovered the poo (which a source tells me the occupant initially believed to be \u201ca stick\u201d), the rower returned to clean up his literal shit. But personally, I don\u2019t think this makes the crime of the poo any better - it was an inexcusable and filthy act of barbarity. This incident has for weeks been covered up by the mysterious workings of Trinity\u2019s boat club. In fact, multiple of the deviants who participated in the events of the Shitgate story are, or have been, senior members of the boat club committee. But now, following my investigative endeavours, I present my evidence to Camfess in the hope of bringing to light the depravity of some members of the First and Third Trinity Boat Club. I can only hope that by sharing this information, which I believe to be firmly in the public interest, some rowers will come to realise the need to stop and think about their actions, and stop plaguing Trinity with their behaviour. I can only assume that any poor soul who has read this far is as bewildered and revolted at Shitgate as those of us doomed to inhabit Trinity have been. We can only live in the hope that the cursed hellscape of moral corruption and vileness that is Trinity College will one day change for the better."

My friends have been hit on, had suggestive/weird comments made to them/about their sex lives, approached online etc by Caius porters and it\u2019s so fucking creepy. Big difference between trying to be friendly within professional boundaries and just being outright weird but college simply doesn\u2019t care/listen\n\nAnd it\u2019s a bit stupid to suggest talking to a porter when you literally can\u2019t get into or out of college without going directly through tiny plodge - it doesn\u2019t exactly make it easy to raise a complaint without making your life incredibly awkward every time you want to go to a supo/hall/chapel/etc, does it? I've thought about saying something before but it just makes the student/porter power dynamic even more intense when you can't even say anything without making the problem worse.\n\nThat\u2019s not even to mention how suspicious it is for a \u2018third year\u2019 to have such a detailed knowledge on how exactly the porters operate, but anyway\u2026"

Once an hour they do the rounds of the external and internal areas of the properties on Harvey Court site. They do this to make sure people who arent meant to be there arent there, considering there is no external wall to the site to keep people out.\n\nSecond, porters (except the rare grumpy ones) smill at everyone and there are a few porters who will *shock horror* wink and smile. You arent being singled out - they are being friendly. Reguardless of sex or gender, some porters do this.\n\nYes porters have copies of room keys, but porters are always on duty in pairs and any keys taken need to be signed out and recorded - the porters lodge also has a 24hr security feed that is viewable by the other porters lodge and the headporter. A porter is not about to take a key and enter your room becasue they would literally be instantly fired.\n\nI'm sorry this made you uncofmortable, but to take this to a public forum and potentially impact the career of this porter over this is childish. If you have a genuine issue, you can find the email of the head porter on the Venn to make a complaint, or visit his office in Old Courts."

I did laundry and walked from my accommodation building to the laundry room (carrying a laundry bag) and the porters office is on the way there but not like directly in the way/not structured in such a way that students naturally make eye contact with porters. Well when I walked out, the porter smilled and looked at me from inside the building that is quite far from where I was (which was outside as well). Then maybe like 40 minutes later, he came into the laundry room (there was a male student which I am so glad for) and the porter didn\u2019t really look at him but he did at me and he winked at me and idk I just felt very uncomfortable. Why would a porter go into a laundry room at all, especially a night porter come in. And also this porter is 50 ish. Winking at an 18 year old. And porters can access our rooms so I am putting furniture against my door because I can\u2019t sleep comfortably otherwise, and I am scared. I AM SO SICK OF MEN. Admin if you reject this pls can you post where o can go to because I don\u2019t know what to do."

Caius has an unfortunate and probably deserved reputation for promoting the patriarchy/being old fashioned/letting women join very late. \n\n3. The caius stereotype is a good looking, sporty student who parties a lot and isn't very clever - we're ken, we have gonville and kenergy."

      "text": "Was walking around Gamla Stan in Stockholm when we saw a poster advertising the Caius choir concert on July 5. Decided to be an encouraging uni member and support the choir by going to the concert. Unfortunately got to the cathedral (concert location) about 2-3 minutes late and so went up to open the big cathedral doors (planned to slip in the back) where multiple signs for the concert were displayed. Lady probably working for the cathedral opened the door saying the cathedral was closed for a concert and we needed tickets (I\u2019m unsure if this was tickets for entering the cathedral or for the concert cause we usually just buy tickets within the chapel for cam concerts) and that we should come back the following morning at 9. I don\u2019t know if I was socially profiled as a tourist and they decided I was not there for the concert, and unfortunately they locked the doors in my face before I could explain I was there for the concert and not the cathedral. At that moment I was quite shocked, but then in the following 20-30 minutes I watched the fiasco of another 10 or so people trying to open the doors to watch the concert as well. Interestingly, there were three people who persevered, 2 of who managed to be let in by the cathedral staff unlocking the large doors - probably because they had digital tickets. Sadly the third person who appeared connected to the choir in some way was not allowed in, perhaps because they didn\u2019t have a ticket? They had appeared to have made a call to someone which had resulted in the cathedral staff unlocking the large doors for them, but they weren\u2019t allowed in because they didn\u2019t have a digital ticket. I hope the concert went well and perhaps they locked the doors early because they were recording the concert or something similar, but I have a few questions about this that I would like to ask: 1. Is it common practice to lock the doors three minutes after the stated start time? 2. The posters that were advertised around the cathedral didn\u2019t say anything about prebooking tickets, was there a place detailing this? 3. What was going on?"

I'm looking forward to using this college as a platform for my own personal interests, including my obsession with ducks. And if you don't like it, too bad. Edmund Gonville: I can't believe you're being so selfish, John. The college is supposed to be a center of learning and scholarship, not a platform for your personal interests.

My interest in ducks is perfectly valid, and I will do whatever it takes to pursue it, even if it means using the college as a platform. Edmund Gonville: You're being ridiculous, John. Your interest in ducks is not valid, and it's not worth sacrificing the college's mission for. John Caius: Oh, screw you, Edmund. You're just a stuck-up, elitist snob who can't appreciate the beauty and complexity of ducks. I will use the college for my research on ducks, and there's nothing you can do about it.
