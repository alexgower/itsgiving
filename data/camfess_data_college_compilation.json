Some items are usually gone by 9 and they won't be bothered to make more because it is 9. I wonder how they come up with their own brekkie then. They literally RUN to close and lock the door at 9 to prevent any latecomers from having their meal, but they are tortoise-slow to serve meals. If they really have an issue with overworking, they should sort out their contract with the college instead of letting it all out to the students, who might be just putting up with it so that they make no fuss, get the degree, and get the f out of here."

I think the others are starting to see through my attempts to discuss the ethics of cannibalism. What started as a joke is now becoming a source of fear and distrust among the pack.

      "text": "I really enjoyed Newnham Garden Party on the whole and thought it was well-planned overall with good music, drinks, and atmosphere, but my experience was somewhat soured by seeing the owls that were tethered in an area on one of the lawns. One of them was tethered directly in the bright sun, which was so blazing this afternoon that I had to look for shade after 30 minutes in it started to make me feel faint. I can't imagine how that would affect the sensitive eyes of a creature adapted to live in the darkness. The owls were also all surrounded by students, who did their best to be respectful as far as I saw but did get quite close to get photos sometimes and were naturally having fun (as they should be!) so were sometimes a bit tipsy and having loud conversations, not to mention the noise from the main band across the garden. One of the birds looked visibly distressed at points, but the keeper was busy with a queue of students waiting to take photos with the owls on their arms and didn't check on the tethered birds once that I could see in the 30 minutes I was there. I don't think it's anyone's fault who attended the event, who wouldn't have intended any harm, but owls are nocturnal creatures that prefer quiet environments and a loud, sunny, garden party seems like it would naturally make them stressed and unhappy."

      "text": "Why is St John\u2019s Voices really being shut down? It is a very successful choir and provides opportunities for female singers of all vocal types, while the main college choir does not include sopranos, limiting opportunities for women. Indeed, there is currently only one female singer in St John\u2019s College Choir. The statement put out by John\u2019s regarding music in the college (https://www.joh.cam.ac.uk/music-college-st-johns-statement) implies SJV is sucking up resources which could instead be used for more accessible music opportunities including \u2018masterclasses in music, for example on song writing\u2019 and supporting \u2018new opportunities for non-auditioned singing\u2019. The implication seems to be that SJV is somehow elitist. Additionally, the statement claims \u2018Students\u2019 preferences and experiences in music today are different from those of previous generations, and many of them have had fewer musical opportunities in school than might have been the case in the past.\u2019 This implies SJV essentially is being scrapped because state schools are failing to provide music opportunities and training to pupils. This is pretty sad and illogical if true. Additionally, the college stresses in the statement the \u2018significant resources currently devoted to St John\u2019s Voices\u2019, but I wonder how much the choir really costs to run. The whole move to scrap SJV seems rather underhanded and I don\u2019t see why a high-level choir like SJV cannot coexist with more accessible music opportunities, especially in a college as rich as St John\u2019s. By the way, I am not a member of SJV, I am just confused about why the choir apparently needs to be scrapped. Here is a link to the petition to save SJV: https://www.change.org/p/save-st-john-s-voices-stop-cutting-opportunities-for-female-singers-in-cambridge"

I get other colleges are raising rent prices but that is taking the attention away from a college charging incoming freshers and existing undergraduates within the 13-16k range for rent. This is a college which boasts its state school stats. This is a college that does not have the historic funding Johns and Catz do, these colleges can access the funds somehow but are possibly reluctant. Lucy Cavendish is a college that has no long term plan, no back up plan and no funding to ease the situation and yet keeps growing in size. It provides no bursaries and inadequate financial support and funding. The attention and pressure needs to remain on Lucy Cav, help us please."
