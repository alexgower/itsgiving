There weren\u2019t any academic/health reasons so put it down as MH for the EAMC (not entirely untrue as the family situation had aggravated a lot of cPTSD stuff that I was previously managing). Returning to the abuse felt like the path of least resistance but was the absolute worst thing for my MH & wellbeing. \n\nNone of my friends at Cam would think this was the case - I seem entirely self sufficient and financially could walk away from the situation, but have found it really hard to extract myself emotionally. I\u2019m too embarrassed and frustrated with myself to be honest with anyone about it. \n\nI have had the worst year of my life. The only light at the end of the tunnel has been returning to Cam to escape from it all, but I\u2019m running low on hope. I wish I had some advice to give you."

    "text": "#Camfession40859\n\nCN: classism\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nI know this isn\u2019t exactly a new take, as I\u2019m sure there have been numerous camfesses that say similar things, but I have genuinely been so disappointed by the levels of classism and elitism that I have witnessed at this university. I have heard even day to day conversations that jokingly patronise and mock those from lower class backgrounds, though often implicitly, or those who those who have not come from traditionally privileged families. That\u2019s without addressing the intrinsic divide created by institutions such as drinking societies that benefit, generally, those who are conventionally attractive or from certain backgrounds. I know it all sounds so obvious, but I am sick of certain groups of students at this university portraying that they are better than others who either are not as privileged as they are and so can\u2019t keep up with their \u2018private school-esque banter\u2019, or not so ostentatious so that they are perceived by them as irrelevant. To make it completely clear, being a member of a drinking society or a certain kind of social group at this university makes you absolutely no better than any other person here- just because you fall into a part of the social system at this university that lifts you up just because you (often, though not always) happen to come from a certain background that gives you 'good enough chat' that you\u2019re considered acceptable, that is by no means any achievement. There are some incredibly impressive, lovely people at this university that slip through the cracks and are mocked by other groups simply because they don\u2019t fit their exact mould of acceptability. And it\u2019s far from an exaggeration- I have heard so many conversations that put down such people and where those involved lift each other up out of nothing other than wanting a reason to feel superior but due to no real work or achievement of their own- only the type of school they went to or culture they happen to have been exposed to. To be clear, I don\u2019t mean in terms of academics and do truly believe everyone here academically deserves to be so from what I have seen, but what I refer to is rather the culture of elitism among some."
