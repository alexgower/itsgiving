When I worked camp, we were working 12-16 hours a day, with one day off every two weeks. The pay, when you take account of that many hours, was less than minimum wage. We also had to pay for our own dbs checks which were docked from wages, despite the fact that our contracts said they would cover expenses like that. The kids themselves were *mostly* fine. They are from very wealthy backgrounds, and act like it, but most are alright. But when you do get a bad one, its awful. The camp is getting too much money to kick them out so nothing is done lest the parents complain- I won't go into the incident I'm referring to because it was awful but suffice to say the police should have been involved and weren't called. Then there's the fact that in many of these jobs you're the 'welfare' person. Its important to note that most courses you have a site manager and a deputy, and then your student workers. That's it. You're left to deal with these kids mental health without any support, and the extra stress on them from being away from home means that sometimes very serious incidents occur. I ended up with one of these, and was offered support only by my fellow student workers not management. Its great if you had a good experience, but personally I could never in good faith recommend working one of these courses. They're cash grabs for management, and student workers are left to deal with very serious child protection issues which should be left to professionals."

      "None": "Following #Camfession41160, things I wish I'd heard as an undergrad:\n\n1. It\u2019s okay to not force a friend group, and to focus on quality over quantity in friends. \n2. You don\u2019t have to feel guilty about going out for days in a row, or feel like you\u2019re not having enough fun because you\u2019ve worked for the last 3 days. It\u2019s all about balance. \n3. Social media is a lie. In Cambridge it\u2019s an even bigger lie.\n4. Everyone is still growing, learning, changing etc. You\u2019ll drift in and out of connections and friendships, partly because you are becoming different people. \n5. Relationships, dating and meeting people are often seen as a big part of uni life. They can enrich your experience, but if it doesn\u2019t happen, it doesn\u2019t happen, and that\u2019s okay. Equally, if you do end up in a relationship, this can be amazing, but also please look after yourself, maintain those friendships (please do not drop your friends), and keep doing you- you were a person before the relationship, and you will be one after. \n6. Breakups are hard wherever you are, but in a tiny place like Cambridge, where everyone knows everyone, and it\u2019s hard to get space, they can be even harder :( Take as much time as you you need, and don\u2019t feel like you need to rush the healing just because of how fast-paced term life is.\n7. Take BREAKS. Like actually. Especially over the summer and in holidays. Reconnect with home friends, family, family friends\u2026 whatever makes you happy! Live for a bit outside the bubble.\n8. Work as you go along. Cannot emphasise this enough. From a humanities student, actually read and research for your essay every week, write notes, gather material. It will mean revising is simply shortlisting and cutting down notes you\u2019ve already made. So much easier and the absolute key to success and not feeling super overwhelmed just before exams.\n9.  Try things! Try going out, try extracurriculars even if you don\u2019t think you\u2019ll be good at them, say yes to things- take risks. Lots won\u2019t pay off, but some will, massively. You never know what you might end up loving, and you never know what amazing people you might meet. \n10. There unfortunately are, like everywhere, some toxic, not-so-nice people here. You won\u2019t get on with everyone. Friendships you thought you\u2019d leave with will end. People can be cruel. Behaviour will get tolerated. But there are also incredibly kind, fun, hilarious and interesting people out there too. \n11. Please do not compare. It is the absolute worst thing you can do. Don\u2019t compare your grades, your social life, your dating life, what job offer someone has. Everyone is going at their own pace and has completely different priorities in life. Some people really want to leave with a relationship, some people are focused on getting a friend group, others put all their time into extracurriculars. You can\u2019t do everything, and you do not have to juggle it all at once. Remember everyone else is in the same boat. \n12. Lastly, remember that everyone has a unique uni experience. It might not be what you expected, and it's okay to feel sad that you didn\u2019t get everything you wanted out of it. But you should also appreciate the moments where you achieved things, or experienced things you never thought you would. \n\nHave the best 3 years here!"

Get reading stuff that are not on the reading list not just for extra credit but for wider knowledge \n2. If you think a supervisor is a bit dodge chances are you are right. Don\u2019t let that decide your experience with the paper. Supervisors are temporary, grades are unfortunately forever \n3.join any society that will take your mind off work. This is essential. \n4.keep a fairly busy schedule that includes non-negotiables like when you have lunch, hanging out with friends etc\n5. Keep and re-read essay feedback even when it\u2019s painful, there is some truth in most feedback \n6.make friends on your course and also make friends on OTHER courses\n7.you must never be afraid to ask for help, it is rarely offered so freely at university\n8. If you can secure notes and help from older years,do so promptly like in Michaelmas\n9.work out why you are being taught said papers. They all have a purpose even if it doesn\u2019t seem so. Also there is always a reason why a paper is compulsory, pay good attention you\u2019ll need it later.\n10. have some long term goals beyond grades. You might not end up doing them but it certainly helps to motivate you.\n11. Don\u2019t bother with people who continually compare \n12. This is a hard one to say BUT if you feel that you must intermit. Do so, don\u2019t worry about your friends graduating that isn\u2019t the most important thing, you are :) \nP.S you\u2019ll be okay\n13. try and get outside as much as possible \n14. Go to social events\n15. Write for something else that isn\u2019t your degree (very humanities directed) it really improves your writing \n16. Your opinions matter but in the context of what you have read so get reading \n17. You are allowed to say no and sit some things out.\n18. keep in touch with someone outside of uni, they\u2019ll be a breath of fresh air\n19. You can do absolutely anything if you really really wish, nothing is too good for you and no one is inherently better than you. Don\u2019t let academics\u2019 opinions of your potential decide for you\n20. Keep your head up. You are a Cambridge student, what a legend. \n\nBest of luck to you and all your endeavours and if you can complete this, then the world is most definitely your oyster!"

I am a second-year PhD candidate at the Faculty of Education conducting a study about the sense of belonging among first-generation women students at Cambridge. I am looking for women from underrepresented backgrounds (e.g., state-school and BAME students) to discuss their experiences here. I also speak to their mothers to understand the family's support in their children's educational journeys. So far, I have interviewed very inspirational women, but I am struggling to find a couple more. As a student parent with experiences overlapping both mothers and daughters participating in my research, I can relate to my participants on a personal level. This connection helps ensure that conversations, while in-depth, are relaxed and informal. Participants will be anonymised to ensure your privacy.

We didn't have exams because of COVID and I genuinely think that I would've failed if it wasn't for that. 2nd year was no better and I really thought I was going to do terribly for my entire degree. I didn't understand anything and was really struggling. Third year I came very bottom of the 2.1s, and in my fourth I ended up on a 2.2, and was disappointed. But I finally found something I enjoyed and was good at which I did for my project. My supervisor was still happy to take me for the PhD. Now I've just had my first paper accepted and I'm submitting a second one next week. The point is, you might feel like you're failing now, like nothing's gonna work out and you're the stupidest person in your year. But people are genuinely right, things will get better. Just go out there and find what you're good at and what you enjoy. It doesn't matter what that is, whether it's academic, helping other people or just fun.

It\u2019s totally normal to have very mixed feelings about graduation or even feel disappointed especially if you did not have a wholly positive time here but you said yourself you were very close to a First which any graduate program or employer will be impressed with especially as it is Cambridge. I\u2019m in something of a similar position myself although not a finalist (high 2:1 given very extenuating circumstances which affected both academics and socialising when others were able to enjoy their time and work hard while I was completely in survival mode and my parents have no understanding for how it feels to feel like a \u201cfailure\u201d even when you are objectively doing very well and my college has been dismal) so I fully understand that anything anyone says won\u2019t take away from what you\u2019re feeling deep down.

I had people who I got on with really well at Cam and who I remain in touch with on some level. What I've learnt is that most people are in your life for periods of time and when you move on you meet new people who are just as nice but you have more in common with because you are at the same point. I've also become friends with people who I've met in my career who were at Cam when I was but I didn't like then.

If the disparity was greater than that the markers met and discussed and if they still disagreed a third marker was called to mark blindly and this was resolved with their intervention. The only downside can be that more senior academics tend to strong arm the junior... I would strongly urge you to start a formal issue regarding marking, involve your reps, your college, find sympathetic staff etc. They won't do anything unless there is a lot of pressure and it persists."

Then, on results day, I find out I got a 60 in said paper.\n\nThe next day, I requested my notesheets for said exam, and found this out (see pictures below). Since the exams for my course are double-marked, there are two notesheets. For the second question in particular, the first examiner gave me a 46 (a THIRD) and the second examiner gave me a 72 (a First) for the same question\u2026 just how is this possible? How can one faculty have such stark disparities in marking? I have many questions and little answers as the Cambridge marking system is deemed so infallible \u2014 through the double marking system \u2014 that no appeals are allowed.

However my insecurities would always get the better of me; I suffer from abandonment issues due to past friendships and relationships and I ended up ruining this friendship by carrying those anxieties.

My graduation is in a few days but I couldn't be any less excited. I'm crying myself to sleep most nights and as much as I try to distract myself, I keep beating myself over what I could've done differently to not lose him as a friend.

I didn't drink much though. \n\nI think most people find it cool, but a large minority look down on it like you. Which is totally fair, it's absolutely selfish. I want to spin it as a form of protest against a tradition that pressures people to waste their money on gross excess, but that wasn't my intention. \n\nI would rather not attend the balls than pay to attend. And if I was caught I would have happily left and probably been glad to get to bed.\n\nPersonally, the other big reason why I sneak in is because I feel too insecure in my friendships to make big plans way ahead of time like that.

I ran into a gorgeous lady in my corridor a few nights ago and was hit by a cloud of her exquisite perfume and it was lovely!

      "St John's": "Why is St John\u2019s Voices really being shut down? It is a very successful choir and provides opportunities for female singers of all vocal types, while the main college choir does not include sopranos, limiting opportunities for women. Indeed, there is currently only one female singer in St John\u2019s College Choir. The statement put out by John\u2019s regarding music in the college (https://www.joh.cam.ac.uk/music-college-st-johns-statement) implies SJV is sucking up resources which could instead be used for more accessible music opportunities including \u2018masterclasses in music, for example on song writing\u2019 and supporting \u2018new opportunities for non-auditioned singing\u2019. The implication seems to be that SJV is somehow elitist. Additionally, the statement claims \u2018Students\u2019 preferences and experiences in music today are different from those of previous generations, and many of them have had fewer musical opportunities in school than might have been the case in the past.\u2019 This implies SJV essentially is being scrapped because state schools are failing to provide music opportunities and training to pupils. This is pretty sad and illogical if true. Additionally, the college stresses in the statement the \u2018significant resources currently devoted to St John\u2019s Voices\u2019, but I wonder how much the choir really costs to run. The whole move to scrap SJV seems rather underhanded and I don\u2019t see why a high-level choir like SJV cannot coexist with more accessible music opportunities, especially in a college as rich as St John\u2019s. By the way, I am not a member of SJV, I am just confused about why the choir apparently needs to be scrapped. Here is a link to the petition to save SJV: https://www.change.org/p/save-st-john-s-voices-stop-cutting-opportunities-for-female-singers-in-cambridge"

It's the system.\nMore specifically, May Balls are problematic because:\n- they bring private security guards into people's homes (remember college is some people's year-round home)\n- they kick students out of their rooms (shoutout to colleges that don't do this)\n- they generate large amounts of waste (even compostable packaging still generally ends up in landfill)\n- they cement and make obvious Cambridge's gaping class divide\n- they foster a collective delusion that \u00a3100+ is a reasonable amount to pay for one night. At any other university in the UK minus Oxford, students would rightly wince at an event over \u00a350\n- the noise\nIf you quietly agree with this but feel like everyone's going to a ball, rest assured you're not alone! So many students don't, and never, go to the balls, and instead have delightful May Weeks year-after-year at the free or reasonably priced events, hanging out with friends, working on the causes they believe in, and/or making the most of the beauty of Cambridge in the sunshine."

      "None": "Cutting the queue at may balls is perhaps the ultimate test of the character of a Cambridge student:\n\n-Anyone can do it, fairly easily, and knows they probably won't get ejected or turned around. The worst that can happen is someone arguing with them, which rarely happens and wouldn't force them back anyway. This would be different if colleges enforced this with actual consequences, but they tend not to.\n-It's easy to do mental gymnastics to justify it (\"Somebody else did it\", \"I had a reason for being late\", \"It's not that deep\", \"This one person I technically know is standing near where I cut in\"). These are bullshit and don't need to be refuted, but since some of the people reading this are said queue-cutters, I'll point out that you could just as well go BACK in the queue to join your friends (I do this when necessary), or even (nobody does this) both move to the middle of your two locations, both of which would be much less disrespectful to those around you. Additionally, any amount of \"deep\" or \"not that deep\" that \"it\" is equally describes the impact to you of just joining the queue like a normal person.\n-The consequences of cutting the queue are plainly visible: everyone who's being inconvenienced is standing right there. You could even count them if you felt like it. \n-It's well-known that (unless you bought a queue jump or dining ticket or something, in which case you wouldn't be there anyway) everybody paid the same amount and has the exact same goal. Any particular justification the queue-cutter makes up doubtless applies to quite a few people behind them who haven't cut.\n-The queue-cutter's behavior relies entirely on other people being less selfish and not just cutting in front of them later. It is possible only because the person who does it is more selfish than their peers.\n-Everyone had the exact same opportunity to show up whenever they pleased and join the queue. There was no random or favoristic allocation of queue positions.\n-Finally, cutting the queue is plainly visible (and annoying) to all the people waiting. There is no way to hide or misrepresent the behaviour to onlookers, making those who do it truly impervious to both internal conscience and external judgement.\n\nOn further thought, this isn't *just* a reflection on a given student's character, but on the fact that they live a life either by privilege or by chosen associations where they're protected from social consequences for being a dick. I thought about ending this with \"Do better.\", but I have no hope, so I'll just stop here."

One of them was tethered directly in the bright sun, which was so blazing this afternoon that I had to look for shade after 30 minutes in it started to make me feel faint. I can't imagine how that would affect the sensitive eyes of a creature adapted to live in the darkness. The owls were also all surrounded by students, who did their best to be respectful as far as I saw but did get quite close to get photos sometimes and were naturally having fun (as they should be!) so were sometimes a bit tipsy and having loud conversations, not to mention the noise from the main band across the garden. One of the birds looked visibly distressed at points, but the keeper was busy with a queue of students waiting to take photos with the owls on their arms and didn't check on the tethered birds once that I could see in the 30 minutes I was there. I don't think it's anyone's fault who attended the event, who wouldn't have intended any harm, but owls are nocturnal creatures that prefer quiet environments and a loud, sunny, garden party seems like it would naturally make them stressed and unhappy."

Every single expense must be raised through ticket sales. Ask anyone who has worked on a May Ball committee, security to stop people from sneaking in is hugely expensive. This must be covered by increasing ticket prices. All the food, drink, and NME events consumed by people who snuck in must be covered by increasing ticket prices. There is no way around this. May Balls break even, so paying customers must cover the losses incurred by those who haven't paid. The ONLY thing for which this is not true are the musicians, as consumption is non-rivalrous, yet even here people who sneak in free-ride. It is therefore the case that students who sneak in directly cost other students money. I really do not understand why this point is not made more often. I know multiple people who complain about high ticket prices making Balls inaccessible for lower income students, who then do everything they can to keep ticket prices high by attempting to sneak into every Ball! I think its probably because students are so used to events being ran by profit-making companies which can firm the costs that they then translate this mindset over to the non-profit May Balls. Either that, or people are too afraid of being seen as 'lame' by criticising the practice. I see it as akin to as if half the students within your college simply shoplifted all their meals from the dining hall, and so prices had to be increased for those who still pay. You are costing fellow students money!!!!!! Please can we stop doing this!!!!"

I have heard even day to day conversations that jokingly patronise and mock those from lower class backgrounds, though often implicitly, or those who those who have not come from traditionally privileged families. That\u2019s without addressing the intrinsic divide created by institutions such as drinking societies that benefit, generally, those who are conventionally attractive or from certain backgrounds. I know it all sounds so obvious, but I am sick of certain groups of students at this university portraying that they are better than others who either are not as privileged as they are and so can\u2019t keep up with their \u2018private school-esque banter\u2019, or not so ostentatious so that they are perceived by them as irrelevant. To make it completely clear, being a member of a drinking society or a certain kind of social group at this university makes you absolutely no better than any other person here- just because you fall into a part of the social system at this university that lifts you up just because you (often, though not always) happen to come from a certain background that gives you 'good enough chat' that you\u2019re considered acceptable, that is by no means any achievement. There are some incredibly impressive, lovely people at this university that slip through the cracks and are mocked by other groups simply because they don\u2019t fit their exact mould of acceptability. And it\u2019s far from an exaggeration- I have heard so many conversations that put down such people and where those involved lift each other up out of nothing other than wanting a reason to feel superior but due to no real work or achievement of their own- only the type of school they went to or culture they happen to have been exposed to. To be clear, I don\u2019t mean in terms of academics and do truly believe everyone here academically deserves to be so from what I have seen, but what I refer to is rather the culture of elitism among some."

Whilst the president of the society welcomed everyone by saying that it was a society designed for people 'from the francophone world and lovers of it', they proceeded to give a history professor the space to celebrate the 1763 Treaty of Paris that was designed to divide up colonial territories between England and France. The professor said casually that 'anyone who is sensitive should leave the room now' and proceeded to describe the nature of the treaty before moving swiftly on to toast 'to peace' between the two nations. A black student, visibly upset, stood up and left the room during the speech. People next to me SMIRKED at this. I cannot imagine how they must have felt in that moment and I cannot believe that despite Cambridge preaching it is inclusive, this institution continues to provide spaces for people to bring up and CELEBRATE painful, violent histories in a totally inappropriate setting and manner. A lot of people were visibly uncomfortable and we had to pay \u00a350 for the privilege. My only regret (apart from going to this dinner in the first place) is that I did not stand up and leave the room with the student in solidarity. Shame on all of us that didn't have the guts to stand up and walk out."

If you're voting in Cambridge, Labour will win whether you vote Green or Labour, so you may as well vote Green.\n2. Tactical voting is only a thing because of our voting system, and Labour oppose changing the voting system, so voting 'tactically' for Labour gives them a mandate to keep things as they are.\n3. All Opposition parties actually get some funding depending on how many votes they get across the country, so e.g. every vote for the Greens funds staffing and research costs for the Green MPs that do get elected. Read more here: https://www.bbc.co.uk/.../uk-scotland-scotland-politics...\n4. Higher vote share = greater media coverage.\n5. More 2nd places for Greens this time means more viable seats to contest seriously at the next General Election, especially as Labour will be in government and so far fewer people will feel the need to vote tactically.\n6. If you're looking at tactical voting sites, just be cautious that many of them use very lazy methodologies and/or recommend voting tactically even in very safe seats where it is not necessary nor helpful."

So far I have excused him (my mistake) because his coming back to my life has always been in moments when I've needed reassurance the most and I always preferred a helping hand/shoulder to cry on/person to laugh with than being mad. I love this person and the need to carry for him like no one else. Obivously, the right solution is drawing the line, be it cutting ties with him once and for all or expressing my anger with him when he decides it's time to contact me again. I don't want to loose him, but probs loosing him is healthier for me? What's your take on this? Oh and yes, we had a failed romance a few years ago, that for me has eroded all the romantic feelings, but none of my loyalty. Ps sorry for all the punctuation mistakes, cba xx"

I don\u2019t mean men in their late 20s, rather men in their late 30s and early 40s. I realise their intentions for dating me were far from honourable but honestly I enjoyed it so much. I never had to worry about planning a date, they were very chivalrous and treated me with lots of respect, not to mention they paid for luxurious meals, shopping and activities. I don\u2019t necessarily need to be paid for but it was such a nice gesture and made me feel taken care of. Well anyway, I stopped this habit after finding out a guy I was seeing was married and hadn\u2019t told me. My friends were thrilled to say the least. But it is so frustrating dating men my own age and feels like a waste of my time. I\u2019ve tried dating in my age range and have to say the past couple of dates I had were a disaster. Firstly, I absolutely HATE when a guy asks for your Snapchat, that app should have been left behind in middle school but for some reason adults still think it\u2019s ok to use it. And the 3 am \u201cwyd\u201d texts really put the nail in the coffin. Then there\u2019s planning the dates, which so many guys our age can\u2019t seem to do. So I always have to come up with a plan which I then have to double text the guy to confirm with. Finally the type of conversations I have with younger guys have just been so shallow. The one that stands out to me is when I went on a date and a guy asked me out of the blue whether I was \u201cdominant or submissive\u201d because he couldn\u2019t hold a conversation regarding anything else. Actually gross. Just to clarify, before anyone gets offended, I\u2019m not suggesting all guys in their teens/early twenties are like this, but it\u2019s a pattern I\u2019ve noticed. My solution has been to step out of the dating world entirely, because it just seems like a massive waste of my time. Anyway, that\u2019s my rant. Best of luck to everyone with their exams (which I should\u2019ve been focusing on instead of writing this)"

They literally RUN to close and lock the door at 9 to prevent any latecomers from having their meal, but they are tortoise-slow to serve meals. If they really have an issue with overworking, they should sort out their contract with the college instead of letting it all out to the students, who might be just putting up with it so that they make no fuss, get the degree, and get the f out of here."

But when the 2:1 grading is so (comparatively) generous, and internships and postgrad places are so much scarcer, the only way to differentiate yourself (in applications, for example) is by having a 1, unlike stem who are practically guaranteed MSci places if they get a good 2:1. It's so frustrating being at the 2:1/1 boundary and knowing that all the extra work that separates the 25th percentile and the 90th percentile is negated by this huge grade range :/"

Work at another May Ball, at your college, or over the holidays if you need this small extra amount of cash.\n\n2: Shein are a hideous company that use what is essentially slave labour to manufacture their clothes. Look up footage of their factories. There is no excuse to use their company, just like Temu, just like Gap, just like H&M. Not sure if you\u2019re just naive but second hand clothes stores DO have a huge range of sizes. Personally, the TK Maxx in town is my haven. \n\n3: I didn\u2019t realise that a company which sells \u00a315 dresses do expert tailoring?? As someone who also needs to buy out-of-the-ordinary clothes sizes, your excuse to use Shein for this reason is inexcusable. \n\nSorry, but it felt necessary to post this. I\u2019m sure people have their own difficult experiences of money and clothes buying, as do I (I receive the full Cambridge bursary), but personally I believe this should NEVER be an excuse to buy into companies that represent the worst of contemporary global manufacturing. \n\nEnjoy your May Ball x"

The secure petition, which takes just a few seconds to sign here: https://forms.office.com/e/vmnnJxkLHc, has already been backed by 110 students, nearing the threshold of 200 signatures to challenge the status quo. Show your support by signing the petition, which aims to make Cambridge student life more vibrant amidst the following concerning issues:\n\n1. Half of the full-time elected sabbatical officers, all from marginalized identities, have resigned from the Cambridge SU. It is unclear whether their resignations were voluntary or coerced.\n2. Remaining sabbatical officer(s) from marginalized identities is/are being prevented from attending and chairing meetings they are mandated to.\n3. The SU has not held by-elections to fill vacant positions despite repeated requests from students, including those with disabilities.\n4. A sabbatical officer, who is also a major union officer of the university, received formal warnings from Cambridge SU for raising concerns about the SU\u2019s finances before the Council Committee for Supervision of Students Union (CCSSU).\n5. A sabbatical trustee, who requested transaction report in past, has been suspended coercively.\n6. Financial transactions have been conducted in violation of the SU\u2019s own finance policy, from an annual budget of over \u00a31 million.\n\nBig questions remain: Where is the effective student representation, and why are the Cambridge SU and the university not keen to fill the vacant positions? More importantly, where is the money provided by the collegiate university to the Cambridge SU embezzled?"

The organisation has been seriously impressive, and the early wins, including Trinity ditching weapons investments, show that it's working. As in times gone by, Cambridge will not stay quiet as atrocities unfold.\n\nI would love to see more effort to include as many of Cambridge's Jews as possible, which means avoiding identifying participants solely as anti-Zionist on leaflets, as polls show the majority of British Jews identify as Zionists (though different people use the term differently), including many who are anti-occupation and anti-war. It also means avoiding ambiguous phrases such as 'from the river to the sea' which - even if not the intent - can read to many Jews as if they're not welcome. Particularly importantly it means not labelling Senate House with the name of someone, Refaat, who described the Hamas attacks as \u201clegitimate and moral\u201d and joked (and I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m typing this) about a baby being killed \u201cwith or without baking powder\u201d - no matter how well-respected his poetry may be, nor how unjust his killing (like any) was.\n\nCambridge's Jews and Israelis, like its Muslims and Palestinians, are deeply traumatised by the horrific events since October 7th, on top of all the violence that came before, and the accompanying surge in antisemitism and Islamophobia, and desperately want an end to the violence. That means the university ending its complicity in destruction, as the encampment demands. To build the broad base we need to end Israel's brutal occupation of Gaza and the West Bank, and win a free Palestine alongside a free Israel, we need everyone on board, and that must include the majority of British Jews who are understandably fearful right now. I really hope the encampment will actively build trust and demonstrate it is a safe space for all who want to see a free Palestine, and that the University of Cambridge will come to the negotiating table and accept the demands."

A struggle to prove their talent to future employers or gain admission to future masters programs.\nComparable 2:1 or above rates at Oxford Warwick Imperial: 85% 90% 90% for good honours.\n\nWhy is it so low at Cambridge? Are we doing easy stuff - that can\u2019t be the case, in fact in terms of rigour or course is hardest in the UK and is renowned for that reason, in fact some courses surpass the difficult of topics at Masters Level at above mentioned universities.\nAre students dumber here? No - around 25% of the cohort has participated in international olympiads on behalf of their country and STEP is by far the hardest entrance exam in the UK.\n\nAs someone who might get a 2:2 or below, I beg all MATHMOS and anyone who cares please like this as support so we can build a case and get word out there! It\u2019s so difficult when I hear people say, \u201cyes I\u2019ll definitely get a 2:1, it\u2019s a first that\u2019s an issue\u201d when for me I\u2019m worried about making my graduate job requirement of 2:1. Yes I\u2019m from Cambridge but this doesn\u2019t mean standards don\u2019t apply to me to.\n\nSU please can you provide us with any tangible support that you can so that we can bring this case to the university and fight for this.\n\nThanks for reading."

Obviously no consequences for him!! Me: has panic attacks, avoids all college spaces for fear of him, eventually has the most awkward conversation ever with college as nobody took any of the other reports seriously. He's still getting on with life as per usual, and college tried to justify his behaviour (like, no???). It's not my fault for not mentioning it earlier until I had a strong case that would've been police-worthy and found people who'd back me up?? And I know other people reported him too (I think)?? And I don't really want to think about the possible impacts on his life or the justifications for his actions after everything that happened to me?? Like, if telling the police would get him jail time (it was a lot of people), it seems *slightly* unfair that college did f*ck all, but ah well, such is life. If anyone feels like going all - but # not all men - the guy harrassed guys to. Like, yep. Anyway, the panic attacks resumed at the start of this term, I feel like I can't breathe properly and have felt like that for weeks, and have an exam basically tomorrow! The joys! F*ck that guy and college for basically enabling him. Just a thought."

      "None": "hello! i relate to you, almost exactly the same situ. it is so hard to navigate a bad-ish home life and uni can be the first time you\u2019re exposed to other lifestyles and realise what was was lacking in your own. take your time and be patient. i\u2019m a postgrad now and i still struggle, but it\u2019s much better than in my first and second years. keep putting one foot in front of the other, prioritise meeting your physical needs and keeping yourself comfortable. your brain is running a marathon right now, and it\u2019s perfectly understandable other things might slip. i know it\u2019s hard with how much people can be in your business at college but try to validate your own \u2018atypical\u2019 eating/sleeping/resting habits because trying to be \u2018normal\u2019 only puts you further in the hole. you have to find your own purpose for doing self-care, for doing hobbies. this is so important for those of us whose families didn\u2019t teach us that we deserve fulfilment in every sense. if your space has too many connotations, maybe also work on finding external spaces you can access that same feeling of comfort. doing this solo helped me to find \u2018my\u2019 spaces, even if they were pretty public - reading in the botanical gardens in summer is a fave. another cliche bit of advice is setting phone reminders with messages of love & hope. sometimes i roll my eyes at mine, but sometimes they hit just when i need them and i\u2019m reminded how hard i work for myself everyday, despite never being shown i should. as you mentioned you haven\u2019t told friends, i think it\u2019s worth having a think about what you can tell people that makes you comfortable & lets them into your life a little bit. i worked with my therapist on this and found concealing my oddities was contributing to general feelings of shame common in abused/neglected people. you don\u2019t have to tell them every detail of your childhood, but it\u2019s not embarrassing to say some variation on \u2018i struggle with x\u2019, \u2018i struggle with x due to some past issues\u2019 etc. your friends want to love & help you, & so many people have issues with e.g. eating for myriad reasons. if it\u2019s come up in a conversation and you haven\u2019t known what to say, maybe reflect for next time and have a strategy for how much info you\u2019re happy to give. sharing authentic love with friends really reinforced how i deserve to be treated & helped me find my voice. plus, it supports you practically in limiting time with family. lastly, bit of a cliche, but you are stronger than you know, and struggling doesn\u2019t always look like an aestheticised cry in the shower. whatever your struggle looks like, it\u2019s valid and it\u2019s not your fault. sometimes it\u2019s struggling to keep your space clean, take medication, cook complex meals, or struggling to see the purpose in getting out of bed if you lived in a household where bed was the best alternative. i still spend a lot of time in bed. but i also have more fulfilling things going on in my life and a better idea of how i want to be treated! i won\u2019t lie to you, this healing process will be long, but it\u2019ll unleash happiness you couldn\u2019t even imagine was possible. just think, there\u2019s a whole universe of love that was denied to us, to discover. you are going to be okay. you are healing."

I never talk about this to anyone apart from therapists because I'm still have a good relationship with my parents and don't want to bring shame on them, but it can feel really lonely and isolating sometimes. This is specific to me, but friends have commented that I have strange eating patterns and spend a lot of time in bed when I'm stressed, and I know it all leads back to how I coped as a child but I've no way of formulating that because it's so embarrassing. The only way I can express it is this bit cloud that lingers over me, affects how I act (eg it's really hard for me to ask for help because I've always sorted myself out) I guess what I'm trying to find is a) maybe some solidarity on how hard it is, or failing that b) maybe understanding that while my situation might not be typical, that means it's okay for me to struggle sometimes compared to others. And maybe if you relate, know that I see you and understand how hard it is, but you are so brave to keep going, and you're not alone."

      "None": "Anyone else feel simultaneously terrified and yet somehow complacent about graduating with no clear career plan? Like many humanities students, I've always dreamt of a successful career in the Arts that would be financially viable to live off, as well as being deeply fulfilling. In recent years I've realized that this is very rare, with most artists, writers, musicians, actors etc having alternative primary careers for years before they become successful - if not for their whole life. I've always been good at doing what I'm told, but since leaving school I've found my motivation gradually wane as it has become clear that in the real world: 1. nobody particularly cares about you (in a neutral way, I'm not paranoid), so no one will come and punish you for slacking off or give you a gold star for going the extra mile, and 2. I have no innate drive to top tripos or get a big corporate job or make a million pounds. In the absence of external validation/pressure or internal motivation, I'm being guided haphazardly by what seems like the right thing to do - but in a world where everyone is constantly encouraged to 'be yourself' and do whatever makes you happy, that is also unclear. Part of the problem is struggling from perfectionism, which I think is common in many high-achieving teenage girls. It feels like if something is not considered extraordinary (like getting all top grades or getting into Cambridge, imo), then it's not worth pursuing. Yet because I have no desire to get some high-flying city job,, I feel like I would be just as happy at home looking after a family and a home than working a 9-5 somewhere underwhelming. The pressure to specialize and commit the 'potential' that you've been told about all your life to one real-world job is very unsettling. I'm aware this smacks of privilege - I haven't done anything to 'earn' the brains that got me here, besides working hard through school, and I know that a degree here is supposed to open doors and provide people with opportunities in careers they enjoy (something not everyone has the luxury to choose). Yet I can't help feeling that I have peaked - that I will never feel as validated as when I'm able to say I go here, something I'm really proud of. It would be nice to know if anyone feels the same way or has any advice about getting excited to graduate and move onto the next stage of life"

It's time for students to demand that the allocation of funds from colleges to the SU once again goes through the jcr so that we can actually make meaningful demands, get some accountability and have power as students, instead of the SU being completely divorced from the realities of it\u2019s student body.

Realllly self-absorbed but they don't always show it early on, biggest players in the game. For this reason they might be good in bed though, so that's a plus if you manage not to get attached. 6/10\n\nFinance: first off, in this you technically have two subcategories - the traditional banker/advisor bro and the more hip startup one. The first can at least rock a suit, but essentially a self-glorified mathmo with zero social sensibility; the second one cannot for the life of them adhere to a dress code but somewhat more socially apt. However, they will both talk your ears off about *their* plans, careers and achievements, good luck if you get 2-3 questions an hour (and this is coming from someone who yaps unprompted).  Really just self-absorbed. 3/10\n\nLaw: similar to the one above in some respects, with the exception that they are taught to read the room and therefore more fun to flirt with. Problem is, they will be the ones to spout really f*ckboy-like clich\u00e9s which might charm some people, but also will undoubtedly give the ick to others. Almost as much of a player group as humanities, just not quite there because (funnily enough) they seem less genuine from the get-go. Best style though. 5/10\n\nSTEM: so hear me out, this is a real hit or miss one. On the one hand you have those who seem like they are playing (they are just a bit awkward and might be anxious, but only end up inducing anxiety in both parties) but others can be quite genuine, and very fun to chat with (them going on about their interests but also listening attentively to yours). Will have to be at least somewhat interested in the arts though to make it work. For the good ones, it's an easy 8/10\n\nDisclaimer 1: Obviously this is not meant to hurt anyone and was made just for fun, also your mileage may vary.\n\nDisclaimer 2: as the sample pool is itself pre-vetted, things like physical attraction, hygiene etc are fairly standard across all groups. I just wanted to state this before you come at me with generalisations."

I met a 2nd year PhD student during freshers week (when I started mine) and we seemed to really hit it off at one of the events. We chatted a few more times when we saw each other and she ended up going home with my hat at a fancy dress BOP (I'll admit it was semi-plannned but she also completely rocked it). I used the hat as an excuse to message her and suggest we could go for a drink for her to return it (maybe not the best idea idk? I'm awkward and it seemed like a good idea at the time). She agreed but then when I suggested a day I got no response \ud83d\ude22 Fair enough I thought, she's not interested. We can just be friends. After Christmas I went to the college bar one night and it was dead apart from her working so we ended up talking all evening, inventing cocktails (which she undercharged me for) and generally solving the world's problems. I thought it was probably my most successful evening talking to a woman I've liked and she seemed to be enjoying herself too so I tried to suggest we should meet up at the weekend (definitely not well, did I mention I get incredibly nervous talking to her?). We left it with me under the impression she was going to let me know when she was free as she potentially had some plans (fair enough, anytime works for me). Again I don't hear anything and the next night I see a friend of hers I know who asks me straight up if I like her, my face says it all and he says it was clear to him and she's figured it out too. So I think ok, she knows you're interested, you've asked her out straight up (however badly) and heard nothing, the feelings definitely not mutual. Decided to give her (and myself) some space thinking I'd move on so as to not make things awkward Fast forward a few months and we've not bumped into each other much apart from the occasional hi in passing. Then we see each other at a couple of society events and it's chill as usual really, we're just friends. But last night again I was at the bar whilst she was working and I got the same mixed signals. It was busier but we were still chatting and she gave me a couple of free drinks and the impression it wasn't just because we know each other a bit. Now I'm very confused, idk if she's uninterested and just not realising the vibe she's giving off or if she likes me too and is just as awkward and shy as I am I'll be very impressed/thankful if you've read this far and wid be grateful for any advice with what to do"

You study here purely for convenience purposes. Low creativity points. You should try stepping out of college, I promise you that taking a few minutes out of your day to study elsewhere won\u2019t hurt! \n\nDepartment library: Very intelligent choice. Where else would you need to be? There\u2019s truly nothing like collectively stressing over the same exams. (This doesn\u2019t apply if your go-to study space is at a different department\u2019s library - if so, you\u2019re just a prick)\n\nUL: You\u2019re either the most secure, mentally healthy person in cambridge (rare) or you simply function off pure anxiety and pressure from the other (similarly anxious) people in the room. There\u2019s no in between. Either way, you terrify me because why would you put yourself through the locker rooms???\n\nBedroom: We get it, you like to work alone with your fancy monitor set up. Or worse, you HAVE to work alone. Either the biggest yapper or a lone wolf. At least you\u2019re in the comforts of your own walls..?\n\nCafe: It may be exam season but one can always dream of meeting the love of their life while you sip on probably your third cup of coffee of the day. Yes, someone may slip you their number but be honest, how productive are you studying at a cafe? \n\nOutdoors: It\u2019s giving main character energy but in reality you\u2019re just a Brit who\u2019s in desperate need for some sunshine. Realistically difficult to get proper work done. Prone to many distractions but I get the appeal.\n\nWest Hub: How does it feel to be part of the top 1% of cambridge students? Excellent food, great choice of seating areas. Nothing else to be said for this underrated gem."

Whether it's big or small, there are plenty of moments in the next few weeks - job offers, sports matches, performances, birthdays and more - to share in joy with others. Take time to relax and enjoy the everyday: the turn to spring, a bite to eat, a movie night. But above all, be the antidote to a toxic term and show generosity and compassion to those around you.

I don't even know how to explain this whole story and I'll try to be sensitive but I think my friend (not at Cam) is faking the disability I have.\n\nBasically I was diagnosed years ago with vEDS. It's a horrible genetic condition, and I'm paranoid about dying young from it. I try to get through it and it's not worth turning it into my life/personality or it just becomes consuming. I just want to do as much as I can and have fun here.\n\nBut recently EDS has become kind of trendy on tiktok, especially the hypermobile kind, and there's loads of influencers for it. They're not glamorising the condition, but there is definitely a part of the viewer base who see using things like wheelchairs as cool from watching them.\n\nLong story short my friend started following these accounts and then tried to get a diagnosis for hEDS. However a rheumatologist told them they didn't have it. Ok sometimes it's worthwhile to get a second opinion. However they then went private twice and got the same response. I didn't hear much about it from them afterwards until I found out they bought a cane 2 months later. They now use it 24/7 when they leave the house. I thought for a while that maybe they have another condition, or are trying to self-manage symptoms. All understandable, I get it because the diagnosis process can suck. But then a mutual friend I'm not very close with told me 2 weeks ago that they got the cane for 'their EDS'. They also removed me from their story on IG and have also been posting EDS awareness content ever since. I am really shocked. I want to think there's been a misunderstanding but I don't know what to do. I also feel a bit disrespected, because I wouldn't wish this on anyone. My condition is not a fad, or a character trait. I don't even like calling it 'my condition' because I don't want it to define me. I don't know whether I should talk to them, ask around for the full story, or cut ties :("

A club night on a Wednesday is not a weekend nor are Sundays with supervisions or lectures on Saturdays. There is no rest and with that comes this continual week, I feel as though it\u2019s why term felt so fast because there were no true demarcation of a break or end. Endless cycles and in a way burnout is inevitable, it\u2019s probably why lots of people here end up in crazy hour work lifestyles because we have been groomed for 3-4 years to do so. It\u2019s a shame but honestly it remarkable how much crap this university gets away with."

It's because I've managed to distance myself from my girlfriend. Increasingly I've realised that we are just not complementary personalities and we've been talking a lot about our relationship recently and what changes we can make, but I know now that I am better off without it. She's awesome don't get me wrong and I wouldn't want to hurt her, but its not going to work long term because she's too clingy for me and incredibly insecure. Although I'll try to stay as anonymous as possible, we're both finalists so I didn't really want to ruin exam term for both of us, but equally it's unfair on her for me to pretend that I still love her the way I used to so don't know how to let her down slowly. Definitely wouldn't want to do it over the phone. Also, we've both got the same friends so the aftermath should be gloriously fun. I suppose its not as bad as we're at the end of our degrees anwyay.

There are a few people I'll talk to briefly if I bump into them but there's nobody I can message asking if they want to meet for a beer so I just go to the bar on my own all the time and hope to see someone. My group are all nice but I work in a separate lab now where I'm completely on my own all day. One of the best parts of my undergrad was the society I spend most my free time doing but just before Christmas I found out some of my best friends in the club were saying some horrible things about me behind my back so I left, which was the right decision but I really miss it. I've started a couple of new things, college and uni, and the people are all friendly but it's just not the same. Atm I'm really just living for the times when old friends come back to visit or I can get out of Cambridge to see them but it's once a month when I used to spend most of my time with friends. I know people will say there's people to talk to but I'm too awkward and I semi know the colleges welfare officers which just makes it even more difficult. Not sure why I'm writing this, perhaps just needed to vent. And to remind you that if most of the time when you see someone they're on there own perhaps it's because they're looking to make friends"

      "None": "Whilst I appreciate the sentiment, I don't think this is that true anymore. It was much easier in the past to coast on the brand recognition of an Oxbridge degree, even with average or poor grades, but because of e.g. significant improvements in social mobility in recent decades (which to be clear is obviously a good thing) and there simply being more people alive, there are now many more visibly competent people from different university backgrounds competing for the same jobs. These factors make jobs which were already competitive before but competence for which could once be signalled through an Oxbridge degree much more competitive now. People now have to go much further to distinguish themselves from their similarly competent peers. (I think some evidence for this is that if you look at older Oxbridge alumni in e.g. prominent positions in the media, they often left university with what many students nowadays would regard as average to poor grades, and indeed grades which couldn't get you the same job today.) So, as much as I appreciate the sentiment, I think people's worries about distinguishing themselves as much as possible academically are actually justified by things like the increasing number of qualified candidates for jobs. You do now have to go the extra mile more than you once did to distinguish yourself as the most qualified candidate for a job, there's no denying that."
