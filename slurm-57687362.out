Why I like Labour: 

-Honest about the policies they can deliver and not deliver
-Nationalising rail
-Improving public services while having fiscal discipline
-Pro-infrastructure building and de facto anti-NIMBY
-Pro-NATO and aren't infected with the "USA bad, adversaries good" brainrot
-Pro-nuclear energy and pylon infrastructure (unlike the Greens who oppose anything that puts a spade into the ground) 
-Experienced people in positions who knows what they are talking about (e.g. Timpson, Reeves, Reynolds, Lammy) 
-Gen Z representation in parliament (Carling, Kettering, Whittome, and Hatton)

I wrote the original post, and in answer to the one comment, I wasn’t being fully serious. To be honest, I actually had an amazing time at Oxford, even if it wasn’t traditionally successful. I’ve grown so much as a person (I was a complete disaster of a human being in my first year, and now I think I’m just about alright), and I’ve made so many amazing friends along the way, as well as having so many fun experiences, so even though Blue, First and Spouse didn’t happen, I think I made the most of it in my own messy way :)

#oxfess31656 Having people replying to this suggesting everyone is “largely in a similar boat” is ridiculous. Those who come from private schools have spent 10+ years being trained for exactly this system. Had schools that trained them up to be good at things (like the stuff you cover in prelims) beyond their A-Level curriculums. 

Not too mention the added financial and social pressures on state schools students who often have neither the financial support or social support that students from private schools which have a long history of sending students to Oxbridge have.

Some people just don’t get how good they have it.

I was on the other side of this last year!!! If it's someone you really really like and think it could last (and ofc if you think they might like you back to begin with) don't be scared to try and go for it!! My bf and I are about to celebrate our first anniversary, we got together last July before I went abroad and I came back a couple months ago :)) it really can work if you prepare for it and make your expectations clear, we spent some time discussing it before deciding to try and it worked out for us so it's definitely not impossible!!

Anyone else feeling a bit lonely and deflated now that the holidays are setting in?  I'm up north and don't have many close friends back home, which is leaving me more time to spiral about feeling isolated with no idea what to do outside of term time. The lack of any structure compared to how busy oxford keeps me is weird and I'm worried it might be a long summer. I'm looking at getting a job, playing sport etc but it doesn't completely compensate for this void which the lack of oxford has left. Hopefully other people feel the same way, any advice/reaching out would be appreciated

British people need to be more patient when it comes to Labour (or any government for that matter) trying to deliver for the country. 

Democracy is slow, chaotic and bureaucratic in nature. Despite the supermajority and regardless of whenever you think they deserved it or not, what is true with any democratically elected governance is that change will take a lot of time to implement. The harsh truth is that many changes that this country needs often requires more than a 5 year term to properly deliver. (Especially things like building houses where we have to balance it with issues like food sovereignty, climate change, nimbyism and immigration). 

If a politician sincerely express the will to enact long-term changes and wants to tackle the political short-termism that has plagued this country for so long, then we as people need to give them a chance to do that. 

There is no such thing as "simple answers" in politics. There will always be tradeoffs and winners/losers in any policy.

So... what if you could 'unbox' your exam results? I wanted to find out, and wrote a browser extension to this effect. You can try it yourself for:

Chrome: https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/oxunbox/jcanmcdhpdnkmokdnoflojmpanibagjo

Firefox: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/oxunbox/

Feedback I've had so far is that this is "horrible", "a terrible idea", and "who would want to use this?". Enjoy!

We are the country of revolutions and toppling corrupt governments as we see fit. Our country was never built nor founded on civility.

And we will do it once more with Macron and the corrupt corporations that taken over our country. 

Tomorrow, many of us young people will vote for Jordan Bardella for the survival of the French nation. French people must come first in a French nation (or what we call the préférence nationale which is a sacred value for us French Republicans).

Definitive ranking of margaritas in Oxford:

Spoons - it’s out of a can, mate, I mean what else is there to say? It’s cheap but unfortunately also tastes it, v limey and will 100% give u heartburn in atik later. Below average but that 2 for 7.50 deal can’t be ignored. Bonus points if u get lucky enough to get a salted rim😍 5.9/10 

The Varsity Club (club night) - I’ve got to admit, my memories of this are vague and unreliable however this tasted completely different to the other margaritas I have drank here. Extremely limey, successfully hiding the tequila flavour, but quite literally giving me cuts around the mouth and acid burnt lips. Heartburn went crazy after 2 of these (don’t ask why I had another one) 6/10

Three goats heads - heavy and I mean HEAVY on the tequila. You definitely get what u pay for in spirit but the alleged peach flavour is nowhere to be found. So much ice that I’m not actually sure this contains anything but thoughts of lime juice, however, won’t give u heartburn which is a major plus. Spenny so gonna dock some points for that 6.3/10

The Varsity Club (rooftop bar) - as strong as its goats head counterpart, but better balanced, to result in a much more pleasant overall drinking experience. V smooth and goes down easy (this depends on you liking tequila, the person I was with went through the five stages of grief upon trying this cocktail) with no heartburn to worry about later. Tastes fresh and with the breeze blowing on ur face, u could almost imagine being in Mexico. Very reasonably priced for a bar with table service 9.7/10

M&S - it’s out of a can but SO much better than the spoons monstrosity. Perfect balance of sweet tequila and sour lime. Bonus points for being strong without tasting strong, and cheap without tasting cheap. Can also be taken on the go (another win against its spoons counterpart). No notes 10/10 

To review: (please give me ideas🫶)

CAN ANYONE PLEASE HELP

I want to go to the US this summer to visit my partner who’s started a Masters over there since Oxford and I’ve never been. Do I need to get a visa beforehand? Where do I do this? How costly would it be etc? Or can I just turn up normally like we can in most countries and they just stamp my passport for 90 days as a tourist visa? 

I’ve heard mixed things about this where you either do need one or you don’t need a visa before travel and I am completely in the dark and don’t know what to do. Can anyone help??

Oxlove to awkward women!! It can get super tiring to always live up to the expectation of being confident and sociable, so here’s the reminder to cut yourself some slack. You don’t always need to keep your chin up, and you are just as much of a girlboss when you’re tongue tied and stuttering as you are when you’re out there actively slaying. Love yourself no matter what queens <3

Tumble outta bed, and I stumble to the lecture,  
Pour a cup of coffee, my only warm protector,  
It’s the same old grind, wearin’ down my mind, day by day.  
From the lab to the library, I’m burnin’ up the midnight,  
Tryin’ to balance my life, but it’s a never-ending fight,  
Chasin’ those dreams, but it’s harder than it seems, every way.

Workin’ 9 to 9, on a chemist's endless mission,  
Barely stayin' alive, in the haze of late-night vision,  
With the books and the beakers, it’s a struggle to survive,  
For the Oxford grind, just to keep the dream alive.

Lab coats and goggles, it’s a fashion of fatigue,  
Running tests and trials, in a never-ending league,  
Pipettes and vials, stacking up in endless piles, all day long.  
Prepping for exams, in the quiet of the dawn,  
Writin’ up reports, until my brain is nearly gone,  
Chasing knowledge high, but the hours just fly, and it’s gone.

Workin’ 9 to 9, with a chemist’s dedication,  
Barely gettin' by, it’s a test of sheer frustration,  
With the theories and the trials, pushin’ through with every mile,  
In the Oxford night, where we’re dreaming all the while.
  
Phosphorescent lights, guiding me through nights,  
In the labs and in the books, where the future looks so bright,  
But the path is steep, and the climb is deep, holdin' on tight.  
Someday we'll break free, find our own decree,  
From the grind to the shine, in our own chemistry.

Workin’ 9 to 9, on a chemist’s endless mission,  
Barely stayin' alive, in the haze of late-night vision,  
With the books and the beakers, it’s a struggle to survive,  
For the Oxford grind, just to keep the dream alive.

Workin’ 9 to 9, we’ll make it through the strife,  
With our heads held high, we’ll find our place in life,  
In the lab or in the world, where the dreams of every girl,  
And boy, will soar, to the heights we’re working for.

The date was meant to be that evening, and after following up where he was I was unmatched. I cried on Magdalen bridge on the way home.  I don’t know why people think this is ok to do to others, and especially being gay where we rely on our community for affirmation and support.

Oxlove: a missed connection. 

I saw you: brown guy with grey hair, oversized hawaiian shirt and black cargo jeans. You walked down Brasenose then Turl street with the girl in the pink blouse. Was she your girlfriend? I hope not.

#Oxfess31001 should genuinely be embarrassed… if you can’t express your support for the people of Palestine without resorting to smug moralism (that reeks of your own privilege) you need to sit down and let others do the talking. There are obviously many workarounds to OP’s complaint about the noise that are perfectly legitimate to point out, but feeling the need post up a wholesale dismissal of their pov for a cheap ‘womp womp’ dunk is really pathetic and reeks of the kind of performative & selective activism that everyone rightly finds insufferable. Politics isn’t a game!

I guess this is an actual confession but after 2 years, I am beginning to like the Oxford union. So I will send an oxlove to it. My new found admiration of the union has been the realisation that during the day it can be a quieter place to sit as it has benches and there are trees for shade. It also has a small library and bathrooms. Therefore, for the use of these facilities and the small comforts they give me, membership is wasn’t a waste of money. I don’t need to speak to anyone, or have a wish to go to any kind of events held there, but I like the trees outside.

No thanks. We don't need or want immigration. We don't want our culture to be destroyed and our crime rate to go up thank you very much. 
Japan is some of the few places where people respect rules and where it is safe for people to walk at night and have vending machines at every street corner. 
We will take the economic hit if it means keeping Japan Japanese.

And atp I'm not sure if that's going to happen. 1/3 the way through and all I've had is once sided relationships or fruitless love affairs 😕

I submitted an examined piece of university coursework that was marginally late (<5 mins) and have got an email saying I will be penalised. 
Reasons for my submission were entirely technical (computer shut down). 

I’m aware this is a long shot, but will the proctors ever waive a penalty based on a technical delay (especially when it’s only 5 mins late)? 
Also, do the examiners see exactly how late something is when applying the penalty?

The sad part is, this will ALWAYS happen for any woman who accomplishes the things she has.

Mitigating Circumstances Question: 
I have just found out that I am pregnant (oops) and I am in final year about to sit exams. 
I will be getting an abortion - as I am quite early on in my pregnancy it shouldn’t be a big procedure but the doctors advice is to take it easy afterwards. Does this sort of thing warrant mitty Cs? Can I even still apply for them. 
Thanks to anyone that can help. 
P.s. don’t have unprotected sex 🫶

I guess "jealous" isn't the right word. 

More like people are bitter of other people's successes and hard work. They assume anyone rich or succesful is because they never did anything to earn it. It can never come from their altruism to self improve and give something of value to society. These people typically whine about problems but never want to actually solve them because they'll need to find something else to blame. They know how to tear down systems but never in a million years how to build one that will last the test of time.

I’m sure this was meant in a jokey way, BUT to anyone feeling like this: some people really thrive off structure (like we had in school) and the independent learning in some Ox degrees (esp humanities) is not suited to everyone! It took me 3 years to figure this out, but if you make your own school-like schedule, with ‘class periods’, lunch time, ‘PE’ (gym/runs/home workouts), etc, you will feel so much more motivated! And as much as I love rotting in bed, I limit it to one day a week — I hate the process of getting out of bed and going out, but I feel so much better once I’m out of my room!

The USSR was based actually. 

Just because you mindless believe in Red Scare propaganda that was manufactured by CIA and MI6 imperialists doesn't invalidate the glorious Socialist legacy that the Soviet Union gave to the proletariats. 

The USSR was illegally crushed through relentless sanctions by the West and took Gorbachev's goodwill by pouring American and British political/economic capital into far right separatists (which what we now call "countries" like "Estonia",  "Latvia", "Lithuania", "Ukraine", "Kazakhstan"). 

But make no mistake. The USSR will return and no amount of capitalist imperialism will ever stop it. The days of Western hegemony are numbered and slowly coming to an end. Socialism will prevail while capitalism will slowly be forgotten to irrelevance like some vile rat.

Will I always feel this level of pressure and anxiety throughout the whole of my degree? People say it gets better after the first two terms, but currently the thought of coming back makes me feel an overwhelming sense of dread. I love my friends and even my subject, but the tutors who never have a good word to say, the constant pressure, and the culture of competing with my friends and never feeling good enough just makes me miserable. I’m willing to work hard, but right now I am so jealous of my friends at other unis who also have time to have fun and not worry about collections every term. It just feels like certain subjects actively try to create a culture of toughness, where there’s virtually no positive feedback and no weakness allowed.

Us When We Shoe the Tabs 

A quasi-religious collegiate university is truly rare, 
In Oxford and Cambridge this experience is preserved with care.
In the battle of the country’s top centres of erudition, 
Oxford by far has the superior traditions.

In matters of ranking, the tabs fall down, 
National surveys still reflect greater Oxonian renown.  
Though as of late, Cantabus has claimed the boat race, 
We’ll be back and tab dominance displaced. 

In naming terms you tabs fall short,
Whereas our founders crafted names that truly exhort. 
No Magdalen daybreak serenade is a shame, 
But hey your proctors are to blame. 

Testament to our greater rizz, we are a cathedral city! 
You’ve only assorted chapels, what a pity?! 
A 13th-century foundation date is hardly a slay, 
Bitch by then we were already a mainstay. 

Your haphazard city centre, 
Is truly a nightmare for all to enter. 
You’re the historic abode of our runaway academics, 
And classing dinner jackets as sub-fusc is an epidemic. 

In the battle of Oxbridge, the og comes out on top,  
For real, Cambridge uni just flops.
Neither plenty of chapels nor good rowing, 
Will ever stop you tab bastards from completely blowing.

Oxhate to the awful memories of bad tutes in my 1st year haunting me right as I'm about to start my final term at Ox. I hate how inadequate I was made to feel because of the module's notorious difficulty, the relentless imposter syndrome it set off, and my tutor's disdain for me lol. Since then, I've progressed immensely by studying topics my 1st-year self never could've imagined I could understand. I should feel proud but it never feels enough- the sadness is lingering and idk how to make peace with it before exams and graduation :(

(Obvs I'm not the first or last person to have had bad tutorials, maybe I need to accept the humility, and see it as an invitation to heal my self-esteem etc etc, but all easier said than done!)

Oh, how I miss the Rad Cam, it's true,
In Oxford, where knowledge always grew.
Its majestic presence, a sight to behold,
A library of wonders, stories untold.

The Rad Cam's beauty, it captured my heart,
A place where learning and dreams could start.
The books and knowledge, a treasure untamed,
Oh, how I miss the Rad Cam, it's never the same.

But fret not, my friend, for memories remain,
In pictures and stories, we'll forever retain.
And though we're far, in distance and space,
The Rad Cam's spirit, in our hearts, we embrace.

Day in the life of an American Oxford Student 🇺🇲:

5AM: You thought I wasn't gonna say coffee? You seriously thought I, an American,  would go without a nice black coffee to start the day off. (Turns coffee maker on). 

6AM: Time for some irony and say my daily pledge of allegiance to the flag of the United States of America... but God save the king. 

7AM: Today is gonna be... 6 DEGREES???? Oh sorry I forgot us Americans are the only ones that used Fahrenheit - yes don't make fun of me. I'm team Celsius but still learning... Ok time for the mental maths... minus 32, times 5 divided by 9...., 42.8 degrees Fahrenheit today.

8AM: Ingesting some Weetabix with some vitamin D pills cos there is like no sunlight ever in this part of the world. 

9AM: Off to my English and Creative Writing lectures and learning about Old Middle English. Basically the American accent is closer to what Shakespeare spoke and we are the ones that get called out for apparently not speaking the "correct" version of English 🙄... Silly Brits. 

11AM: Random thought while studying. Why are your doughnuts in Tesco so small? It's barely enough to keep a mouse going and why is it not shaped like a torus? 

1PM: OMG I've drunken a whole pint of coffee without realising... Whoops? Struggling to stay stable on the sidewalk with all that sugar and caffeine rush...

4PM: Off to the library and reading the Bible. If you can recommend me some King James Bible classes in Oxford do let me know :)

6PM: Ordering some dominoes and it's...... £20!??? What are your pizzas made of? Gold!? Anyways, it does taste slightly better than what we get on the other side of the pond. But then I'm paying more than twice the price I would pay in America so one would hope its better in some way....

7PM: Getting bullied by my flatmates because I said I needed to buy a new fannypack instead of "bumbag".

9PM: Calling my parents back in Tennessee. 

10PM: Prayers before bed and sleep while not knowing that I forgot to buy some coffee today ... All hell would break loose tomorrow as a result...

At least once a week I visit Summertown Gail's, Daunt Books, M&S, Oliver Bonas, and then go down to the centre to do a lap of John Lewis, and pretend that I'm middle class. Like, I'll pretend to be a posh mum type with children named Tabitha and Tarquin and I'm so busy at my high-flying job that I don't have time to make tea, and thus must purchase those posh £20 frozen ready meals from Cook in Summertown (which will be served on Le Creuset stoneware) before Tabitha and Tarquin come home from seeing their private tutor (I've told Tabitha that if she does well in her IGCSEs, we'll take her to Urban Outfitters. And also the Bahamas).
Idk it's really fun I like to think of it as a reverse "posh person cosplaying as working-class". And the stuck-up mums in Gail's (not Jericho Gail's, which is full of students and povvos and povvo students) have good gossip.
I'm still to afraid to go in Anthropologie though, I think they'd kick me out immediately.

Sorry I am so fed up of people receiving full student loans and thousands of pounds in bursaries complaining about struggling to pay rent and buy food, and then jetting halfway across the world for holidays, going to at least one ball a term, buying loads of expensive clothes, spending enormous sums of money on alcohol, getting really expensive haircuts and nails etc etc. Like I'm genuinely sorry you're struggling, I really am, but maybe if you cut back on this ridiculous expenditure and actually budgeted for food and rent you might be fine. I am on the minimum student loan, and am really lucky that my parents can make up the difference so I only have to work during Long Vac, but I cannot afford half that stuff - I'm going to my first and probably only ball of my degree this term, and have to really think about what I buy outside of the essentials but I make do, and I don't complain because that's life.

Your eyes, oceans against  
my own  
crashing waves on ancient stones.  
We wandered through ancient halls,  
silent whispers in every step,  
echoing tales untold.  
In the shadow of those spires,  
our words intertwined like ivy,  
growing, grasping,  
then falling away.  
Leaves carried by the wind,  
a memory, a moment,  
lost in the labyrinth of time.  
The clock hands circle,  
yet we stand still,  
two ghosts in the library of our making,  
searching for a story  
that ends where it begins.

I sold my soul to Kearney
I sold my soul to Bain
I sold my soul to BCG 
And flushed friends down
The drain

I only lived on whiskey
And bored housemates for days
About KPIs and spreadsheets 
I’m not sorry for my ways

I must be a consultant!
There’s no nobler cause, says I 
I’ll hold forth on this ego trip 
Or I fear that I may die

I dream about my pay check 
And cringey suits and ties 
They’ll make my clients trust me
As I steal money before their eyes

You don’t need a girlfriend anyway
When you can get with the Big Four
I’m a sleazy slut for C-suite 
And I’ll always ask for more

Consulting is my fantasy
Through lonely Oxford nights 
When I have a massive office 
I’ll know I’ve done it right

I’ve sacrificed a lot
Upon this righteous path
Fun and sleep and dignity 
But I’ll defend it to the last!

I’ve sold out to McKinsey
I’ve sold out to PwC
I’m a PPEist megalomaniac
But that doesn’t bother me

When are my fellow undergrads going to realise that we are way smarter than postgrads? Almost all postgrads I meet fall into one of these categories:

1) Rich dumb Americans whose parents are paying for them to make tiktoks about their 'Oxford experience'
2) Boring Stem DPhils funded by big Pharma or defence corporations who mope around as glorified lab assistants having no original thoughts
3) Humanities students going into massive amounts of debt to extend their adolescence because they can't face the reality that all the jobs prestigious enough for them to consider are impossible to get or contribute nothing to the world (and sometimes both)

The truth is Oxford will take pretty much anyone as a postgrad as long they're willing to pay for it, or they can find someone else that will. The only impressive postgrads are those with academic funding, and they are a tiny minority.

Secret to studying and revising better for exams: 

1) Stop taking too many notes in lectures. When you are just copying what the lecturer writes, your attention is split into notetaking and listening to the lecturer. It is better to just listen to the lecturer with 100% of your conversation and take small notes during the lecture, and then writing your lectures up AFTER it.  If you have lecture notes available, then actively review what you are going to learn before you enter the lecture hall.

2) Stop rereading your notes. The reason many people do this is because it is the easiest form of revision but it is also the most inefficient.  It gives you the illusion of "effort" when you are using your favourite colouring pencils and drawing really asthetically pleasing revision notes but I'm reality, all you are doing is just wasting time and not actually improving your long-term memory skills. 
Doing practice questions, testing yourself regularly through available practice questions and revisiting the material periodically throughout the course makes revision less burdensome during the exam season and tests your ability much better. This makes revision more uncomfortable, burdensome and harder but being able to endure this is what makes the difference between a student who gets a First and a student who gets a 2:1 or 2:2.

Got an offer to do my DPhil here and I already regret telling my parents. I've been offered a funded PhD in another country and, unless I get my fees covered and a stipend here (seems pretty rare for law), that's probably where I'm going to go this year.
Every day since getting my offer here, my mother has tried to talk me out of going to the place offering me a stipend. I'm sure Oxford is the better university and I'd love to go if I had the option, but I'm not going if I have to pay for it. For some reason she cannot understand this. 
What am I supposed to do besides ignore her for the next five months?

Newsflash, no religious doctrine is infallible. 

Religions have a capability to obtain political positions of power and this will inherently attract criticism like political parties. 

People can glorify their religious beliefs and doctrines as the "perfect Words of the Almighty(-ies) as much as they want but that doesn't change the fact that it is fallible human beings that interpret and "enforce" the religious scriptures. 

Also, this is a university where we have and should have the freedom to critique all doctrines and ideologies. Otherwise what's the point t of university?

Isn't it a double standard that a lecture titled like this can pass off without a question raised? 

'Hindutva and the Problem of Hinduism' why title it that? Went to the lecture and it by the content of the lecture it would have made more sense to title it 'Hinduism and the Problem of Hindutva'. The title is loaded in its nature, apparently the religion itself is problematic and the extremist ideology its partner in crime. Analysis on its politics and theology widely conclude that it is a political outcome and that it has very weak if not non-existing theological backing.

Waiting for the sequel lecture on Jihadism and the Problem with Islam or The Crusades and the Problem with Christianity.

In the annals of Oxford's hallowed halls, behold the prophecy foretold:

1. Seek ye the sacred texts, ancient tomes hidden within the depths of Bodleian Library, where knowledge blooms like desert flowers under the twin suns.

2. Engage in the art of subtlety, weaving webs of intellect that ensnare the minds of professors and peers alike, for the Bene Gesserit know the power of influence.

3. Master the ancient languages, deciphering the cryptic runes of academia with the precision of a Fremen knife.

4. Embrace the rhythm of debate, where words are swords and arguments are shields, honing your skills in the arena of discourse.

5. Forge alliances with the wise and the cunning, for in the halls of power, strength lies in unity, and alliances are the spice that sustains the empire.

6. Delve into the depths of history, learning from the mistakes of the past as the Guild Navigators chart the course of the future.

7. Let curiosity be your guide, exploring the uncharted territories of knowledge like a desert wanderer seeking the hidden springs of Sietch Tabr.

8. Master the art of time management, for like sand slipping through an hourglass, the sands of academia wait for no one.

9. Cultivate resilience in the face of adversity, for the journey to enlightenment is fraught with challenges, and only the strong will endure.

10. And finally, remember the words of the Litany Against Fear, for in the crucible of Oxford, where dreams are forged and destinies entwined, fear is the mind-killer that must be faced with steely resolve.

Thus spoke the prophecy, whispered on the winds of Arrakis, echoing through the corridors of time to guide the seeker on their quest for academic glory at Oxford.

As we embark on this noble endeavor, let us not forget Cromwell's treacherous betrayal of our rightful king, appointed by divine decree. Here's our gallant 10-point plan:

1. Establish Clear Objectives, Gentlemen: Commence by defining objectives that shall fortify your resolve and propel you steadfastly toward victory, much like the unwavering dedication of our royalist cause. Envision yourselves ascending triumphantly at the culmination of this campaign, clutching a distinguished parchment earned through unwavering loyalty and steadfast execution, despite the looming threat of Cromwell's insidious schemes to undermine the rightful authority of our anointed king, appointed by divine providence.

2. Employ Strategic Time Management, Cavaliers: Organize your time with meticulous precision, emulating the disciplined coordination characteristic of royalist supporters. Time management shall serve as your steadfast ally, enabling you to navigate the complexities of study, camaraderie, and personal pursuits with resolute determination, even amidst Cromwell's treacherous attempts to usurp the throne and cast our nation into turmoil.

3. Delve Deep into Academic Subjects, Comrades: Do not merely skim the surface; immerse yourselves fully in the depths of your chosen disciplines, echoing the scholarly pursuits of royalist sympathizers amidst the tumult of civil war. The acquisition of knowledge shall be your most potent weapon, enabling you to uphold the values of tradition and loyalty to our rightful sovereign in the face of Cromwell's deceitful machinations.

4. Embrace Constructive Criticism, Soldiers: Do not shy away from critiques that may come your way, for they shall fortify your intellect and bolster your resolve, much like the valiant defense mounted by royalist forces against the perfidious betrayal of parliament, which has forsaken its duty to uphold the divine right of kings. Constructive criticism serves as a guiding beacon amidst the tumult of uncertainty, propelling you toward academic excellence and steadfast allegiance to our sovereign monarch.

5. Cultivate Networks, Brothers-in-Arms: Forge alliances with esteemed professors, fellow scholars, and defenders of royalist principles, emulating the collaborative spirit of loyal subjects standing against Cromwell's treasonous aspirations. These networks shall serve as invaluable assets, propelling you forward on the path to victory in defense of the rightful monarchy, even amidst parliament's shameful capitulation to Cromwell's rebellion.

6. Maintain Order and Discipline, Cavaliers: Keep your academic affairs in impeccable order, reflecting the discipline and dedication demanded by the royalist cause. A tidy mind and organized approach shall pave the way for your most triumphant endeavors, even amidst Cromwell's attempts to sow chaos and discord in pursuit of his illicit ambition to overthrow the legitimate authority of the crown.

7. Prioritize Well-Being, Soldiers: Remember, the strength of our cause lies not only in our strategies but also in the well-being of our troops. Attend to your physical, mental, and emotional health with the same diligence we devote to upholding the principles of monarchy and tradition, despite the disheartening betrayal of parliament in siding with Cromwell's treasonous plot against the crown.

8. Utilize Available Resources, Comrades: Seize every opportunity for advancement, from libraries to study groups to mentorship programs, mirroring the resourcefulness of royalist supporters in the face of parliament's misguided alignment with Cromwell's subversive agenda. Harness these resources to propel yourselves toward academic victory and the restoration of rightful governance under our anointed king.

9. Refine Academic Writing Skills, Troops: Polish your essays until they gleam with the eloquence and conviction characteristic of loyal subjects defending the honor of our monarch. Pay meticulous attention to structure, clarity, and persuasion, for your written communication shall serve as a testament to our unwavering allegiance to the crown and defiance against Cromwell's usurpation of power.

10. Celebrate Achievements, Brothers-in-Arms: Whether securing victory in an examination or delivering a formidable presentation, take pride in your accomplishments. Revel in the fruits of your labor, for they are the product of your unwavering loyalty and steadfast commitment to the royalist cause, despite the ignoble betrayal of parliament in colluding with Cromwell's rebellion against the rightful authority of our anointed king.

Soldiers, let this guide serve as our manifesto for academic success, echoing the gallant spirit and noble aspirations of royalist supporters during the English Civil War. Together, let us march forward with unwavering resolve and the knowledge that our pursuit of knowledge shall lead us to victory, restoring rightful governance under our anointed monarch and thwarting Cromwell's treacherous bid for power.

@30037 from a fellow scholar, here is how to truly get a first: sever yourself from any interesting literary approach, idea, or information; go for what is safe, which can be understood from what would appeal to particular tutors, or in exams without  select examiners, what would be likely to appease the academic community at large, although with the odd new fact or spin on their ideas to appeal to our psychological need for novelty, and to flatter ego; or, to be more daring, be a ‘maverick’, which entails the same steps, only with settling on arguments from one of the polar opposites that most academics find a safe in between with. That done, pat yourself on the back with how clever you are, and how important the micro study or regurgitation of opinion was. Or, if in the scientific community, do similar, and push the boat out half an inch in some field or another that appeals to specialists at the university. Then, congratulate yourself, and end up on either a seven figure salary or windfalls, with the knowledge that the future is completed by lackadaisical spoilt kids, and textbook-thinking adults.

I need to vent.

I worked extremely hard for a Half-Blue in a competitive Blues sport this year. I was passed over for the final spot in the team for a former star who had phoned it in the whole year. I had started performing better than them in the weeks leading up to Varsity, but when I asked the captain about that, I was told that they hadn’t “paid attention” to my recent performances, saying that “it would have gotten in the way of their thought process.” That former star performed really badly at Varsity. That was my final shot. I feel robbed: I worked way harder than half of the team and didn’t even get to show what I was capable of because of internal politics. I’ve not really touched my sport since, and not sure if I ever want to again. I still love it, but over the decade I’ve spent playing it, it feels like I’ve been continuously screwed over. The worst thing is, no one on the team has my back on this. They all think I’m happy with a pat on the back and an acknowledgement of how hard-working I was, but honestly it feels condescending. I just want my shot…

How to reform the UK economy:

-Offer a reduced cooperation tax, say 15%, for young tech start-ups in the fields of semiconductors, technology, app design and engineering. 

-Prioritise new builds and new council houses for people who have children with a points based system on wealth, age, employment sector and geography. Offer reduced mortgages for people who have more than 1 child. 

-Increase income tax if the person earns over £50k and is still single by 45. 

-Reduce tax on income gained from overtime in tertiary sectors. 

-Integrate industry work experience with secondary education for people who want it. Lower the age for legal employment to 15 and give options for young people to opt-out from GCSEs in exchange for part-time vocational training in key STEM industries. Introduce new subjects like Video Editting, 3D modelling, and Computer Programming. 

-Employ computer scientists with £100k salaries to update public sector softwares including the NHS. Reform NHS to make it a more Bismarckian system like France.

I am sorry to the commenters but self-diagnosis has never been valid and never will be. 

There are valid discussions to be made about how healthcare could be reformed to better accommodate access for people who want to receive diagnosis but then saying that your own biased clandestine "research" of mental illness does not qualify you to talk about a very complex and nuanced medical field - that's a non-sequitor. Psychiatrists and doctors have been studying these for years, some being their careers and you are effectively nullifying their years expertise just because you "feel" like you definitely have it. Especially when Tiktok turns this into a 'trend' or an identity that is equivalent to something like a gender identity as if it is something to be celebrated, this is just an indictment of how anti-scientific and dangerously toxic this whole "self diagnosis" has become. 

Whether you have been diagnosed or not, you are actively harming people if you are glorifying or validating self-diagnosis to the extent that mere 'Tiktok researchers' are better informed than trained medical experts in this field. Stop it.

When on earth did self-diagnosing autism become an acceptable thing to do?

I understand the issue of access but surely this is not the solution. People should expect better instead from their doctors and the government rather than googling the DSM V. I don't even know how people could say it with a straight face- imagine walking around with self-diagnosed schizophrenia or self-diagnosed mania. By the logic of self-diagnosis, if you can self-diagnose that opens you up to anyone, including me 'un-diagnosing' you because you don't seem consistent with my own personal (and non professional) research. You could reasonably claim anyone as faking.

The biggest issue with it is honestly the 'tiktokification' of 'neurodivergence'/'neurospicy'/'Audhd'. There's so many videos over-pathologising normal behaviour, even if it can be difficult to deal with, like uncomfortable social settings or just wanting a routine comfort meal. There's infantilising autism by associating it with plushies, 'aesthetic' stim toys, and 'quirky' special interests. Autism has become a bit of meaningless term and I feel for people who now find it harder to access support.

To say this after Ghana has just past a law making identifying as LGBTQ+ illegal is despicable

Human rights aren't just 'cultural differences', and the protection of human rights is not 'European moral imperialism'

I don't suppose the Nuremberg Laws of 1935 were just German 'culture' and 'family values'?

The moment a state institutionalises hatred towards people, that state loses its mandate and legitimacy. We must deal with these states (direct intervention being a last resort, hopefully human rights organisations in Ghana can resolve this on their own) exactly as we did with Germany in the 1940s

Oxlove to Corpus. We've been so resilient and we've been so good at looking out for each other, it's made more off a difference than each of us realise. Keep holding on, I promise no one here is alone, there are people out there who are willing to care and help shoulder the trouble if you're willing to reach out. 

And to the first years, I'm sure you guys have probably been thrown off in a different way from everyone else, not really being sure how to react or what to think. When we said Hillary sucks, we didn't mean this. It gets better I promise.

Does anyone else think this year is just evidence for the fact that the office of SU President is completely pointless? The Sabbs have done a great job of improving engagement (a bit) and managing affairs on their own. They also have actual responsibilities, rather than just that of a presiding and often disgraced overlord. Who also thinks running the SU should be a team effort not a hierarchy?

Last week I lost my thumb stick, and I was hoping someone might have found it. It has massive sentimental value.

Ah, dear Entz reps at St. Hugh's, let's talk about your halfway hall party...or should I say, halfway there in terms of fun! It's like Mean Girls decided to host a party and forgot to bring the humor along. Maybe it's time to stick to your own clique drama and leave our party waters untainted. Cheers to hoping your next event has more pizzazz and less Regina George vibes!

In the moonlit dreamscapes of slumber's embrace,
RC emerged, a vision, a captivating grace.
With a body sculpted, arms so strong,
In the ethereal realm, where dreams prolong.

A whisper in the night, RC's voice so sweet,
"Vote for me," he urged, a tempting feat.
His manifesto, a seductive allure,
"Make Oxford smile," a promise so pure.

In the dream, RC's smile gleamed bright,
A magnetic force in the velvety night.
As he spoke, his words, a sultry dance,
In Spanish, a heated romance.

His eyes held secrets, desire in the air,
In this dream realm where fantasies dare.
"Vote for pleasure," he softly implored,
A temptation woven, dreams explored.

In the twilight of slumber, passion intertwined,
RC's presence, a fantasy entwined.
As the dream unfolded, desire took its toll,
A plea to vote, a tale of passion untold.

Awakening to reality, a lingering heat,
A dream of RC, an encounter so sweet.
"Make Oxford smile," the words still linger,
In the dream, where fantasy and voting coalesce, a sultry finger.

(To the tune of "Murder on the Dance Floor" by Sophie Ellis-Bextor)

Oh, RC's campaign, a dance floor so grand,
"Make Oxford smile," across the land.
Postgrads rejoicing, in his gaze they confide,
Prioritize their needs, with a charismatic stride.

Welfare and aid, a pledge so sincere,
For students in need, dispelling every fear.
Ethnic, sexual, class, religious, and gender blend,
RC vows diversity, a campaign that won't end.

Reducing prices, a financial delight,
Living in Oxford, now within our sight.
A nice guy, with a grin so wide,
He'll make every student smile, a joyous tide.

(Chorus)
Oh, RC, on the campaign floor,
"Make Oxford smile," forevermore.
Postgrads, welfare, diversity so sweet,
Reducing prices, a dance to the beat.

A nice guy at heart, a promise to share,
Students in need, he'll always be there.
A charismatic figure, on this dance floor,
RC's campaign, a smile to adore.

Bridge:
From the lecture halls to the cobbled streets,
RC's pledges, a promise he repeats.
Inclusive and kind, a leader so bright,
Making Oxford smile, day and night.

(Chorus)
Oh, RC, on the campaign floor,
"Make Oxford smile," forevermore.
Postgrads, welfare, diversity so sweet,
Reducing prices, a dance to the beat.

A nice guy at heart, a promise to share,
Students in need, he'll always be there.
A charismatic figure, on this dance floor,
RC's campaign, a smile to adore.

As the music plays, and the campaign unfolds,
RC's promises, a story to be told.
On the dance floor of elections, he'll twirl,
For RC, the candidate, wants to make Oxford smile.

I was seeing a girl I really liked, we hit a rough patch and she said she needed space. She then slept with this guy it turned out she’d been messaging the whole time we were together. She said it wasn’t planned and they are just friends, she’d just innocently invited him to her room to watch a film led on her bed hugging and things unexpectedly happened… She said she didn’t want anything more to do with him. We got back together last week, she said he’d asked her out again but she’d said no, however she needed to be home early for an essay. By chance I saw a message on her phone from him confirming their meeting in the morning. I broke up with her there and then. Anyone think I’ve done the wrong thing?

Valentine’s Day is scarily around the corner for us oxsingles, so why don’t we designate one library to all the single academic weapons who want to study mysteriously and have cute oxfesses written about them so we can fall in love by the 14th of Feb?
Suggestion welcome ❤️‍🔥

How do I stop caring about what other people think of me? Whenever I hang out with a new group I can feel myself instinctively changing my behaviour to try and get them to like me and I hate it because it makes me do stupid insincere things that don’t really reflect who I am. Either I try too hard to be likeable and come off as weird, or I anticipate this and try too hard to be “normal” and come off as boring/don’t talk at all, and whatever happens I always go home miserable about myself. I worry that I’ll never figure it out.

Study after study shows that prisons damage a women's wellbeing significant more than that of men. 

It is inhumane to lock up emotionally vulnerable women in a state of solitude for protracted period of times. Rehabilitative justice and community service should be given out to all female convicts regardless of the crime committed and the root cause of poverty and capitalism should be addressed.

Everyone should shout outside the radcam as loudly as possible (that's where all the entrenched power is, obviously, and not just a room full of impressively unproductive young adults)

Ok a bit of clarity. While appointing a transwoman as a society women’s officer may well make some biological female members feel awkward, there’s hopefully enough of a chance that transwomen resonate sufficiently with the biological female experience to still be helpful… i don’t know.
The real issue is where a non-gender specific individual gets appointed, or if a women’s role gets included in a catch-all lgbtq+ position that’s then filled by a non binary / questioning person. It just isn’t fair on the majority of women.
